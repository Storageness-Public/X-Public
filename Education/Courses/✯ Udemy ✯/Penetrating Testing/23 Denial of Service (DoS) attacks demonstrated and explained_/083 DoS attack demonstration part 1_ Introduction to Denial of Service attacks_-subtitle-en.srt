1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,780
Okay so once again we find
ourselves here in Kali Linux.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,020
And today I'm gonna do something a bit
different with you, today I'm gonna

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,810
actually perform a DoS attack,
a demo of a DoS attack should I say.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,830
Now, since we can't actually just go and
DOS random sites,

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,950
primarily because we don't have
permission to do so and that's illegal.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,490
You do have an option, of course,
to set up your own virtual environment and

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,170
then you can do whatever you want to
it and it doesn't matter, it's yours.

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,580
Or, you can use a preexisting web
server which you can actually

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,840
practice a DoS attack on.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,080
Now, this preexisting web server
is actually your own home router.

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,600
Your home routers,
they do have web surfers.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,450
You can access their
interfaces via Port 80.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,260
Pretty much all the ones
that I know unless

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,650
it's disabled by default by your ISP
provider or something of a kind.

15
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,080
I don't know, but
they usually leave the Port 80 open so

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,378
the additional corrections and
modifications can be made on demand.

17
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:11,980
Anyway, if the router is yours, you can
pretty much do whatever you want to it.

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,810
And today, I will actually use that
particular web server on my home router,

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,800
which I'm using for

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,100
this DoS testing exercise in order
to practice this sort of attack on.

21
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,250
To demonstrate it, actually.

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,140
Anyway, in the very beginning I have
spoken a little bit about DoS attacks,

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,790
I've explained what DoS is and
what DDoS is, but

24
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,470
in addition to those two you also have
two subcategories for each of them.

25
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,900
You have logical attacks and
brute forcing attacks.

26
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,580
Now logic, basically relies on
logic errors on the other side on

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,720
the web server on the other side and
in a way it handles requests.

28
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,820
So, there were some problems with
Apache where it just kept on stacking

29
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,790
incomplete requests and
waiting for responses on end.

30
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,850
It was pretty easy to DoS that [LAUGH].

31
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,480
Just keep on sending requests and
you didn't need a lot of bandwidth to

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,020
crash the site, but
that was back in the days.

33
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,880
Today they've fixed a lot of things,
but you know no system is perfect, and

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,980
no matter how hard you try and
how much you invest yourself,

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,940
and how much capital you invest into it
there will always be something to exploit.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,260
It's completely impossible to make this
system fool proof against anything.

37
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,020
Against a DoS attack.

38
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,760
Of course,
the big companies like Google or

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,643
Facebook or Twitter, or
something of that kind.

40
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:41,439
Their servers are simply too big to DoS.

41
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,288
You would literally require,
I don't know how many machines,

42
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:51,077
and how much bandwidth in order to DoS it,

43
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:57,870
which is pretty good because my Gmail
account I can always access it.

44
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,050
It's always readily available and
it never goes down.

45
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,640
Fantastic way there.

46
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,660
But if you do remember.

47
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,670
I don't know when was it.

48
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,850
Like a year or two ago,they actually
managed to DoS a PayPal site,

49
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,180
which is pretty bad.

50
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,360
I'm not sure how they managed to do that.

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,720
They probably did have a large amount
of computers in the background.

52
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,710
Basically zombies, hijacked computers
which were generating a lot of requests,

53
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,150
and then eventually the site went down.

54
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,980
Don't hold my word to it, you can feel
free to scream in the discussion that it

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,640
wasn't so, it wasn't that kind,
because I'm not that familiar with event.

56
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,570
I just want to give an example.

57
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,140
Basically what I'm trying to say is
if you have sufficient bandwidth,

58
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,070
either your own bandwidth or
bandwidth combined with over machines,

59
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,480
you will be able to perform
meaningful DoS attacks on websites.

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,940
Brute force attacks on websites.

61
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,540
If you don't have enough bandwidth,
brute forcing won't do you much good.

62
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,610
I can see a question
forming in the discussions,

63
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,150
how much bandwidth would I
need to do this or to do that?

64
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,420
I really don't know.

65
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,030
It depends on how much the server
on the other side can handle.

66
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,580
If you know how much the server
on the other side can handle,

67
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,040
then you can do estimates.

68
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,180
How much speed does it have?

69
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,620
How much bandwidth does it have?

70
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,300
And then you can represent that
in terms of amounts of requests.

71
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,380
And then you can see how many
requests can you generate to

72
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,920
perform a meaningful DoS attack.

73
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,870
For example, I don't know,
I've seen actually partial DoS attacks.

74
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,530
For example, I don't know.

75
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,930
Let's just take a fictitious example for
this.

76
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,830
A site can handle 10,000 users.

77
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,750
And you can actually generate sufficient
traffic to occupy bandwidth for

78
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,680
five thousand users.

79
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,070
And if the site has average login users,
six or

80
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,010
seven thousand, that means that one to two
thousand users won't able to access that

81
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,610
site because of your DoS attack
while 5000 will be able.

82
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,850
So those are kind of a partial attacks.

83
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,910
I'm not sure how useful that is, but
feel free to check that out as well.

84
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,930
What we want to achieve is
a full DoS attack where,

85
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,840
and have no doubt, today what we are doing
is definitely a brute forcing method.

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,360
This is not a logic thing or
something of a kind,

87
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,920
although it can be interpreted as such.

88
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,150
But we are just flooding it with requests
in a very short amount of time, and

89
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,590
since it's our own router here at home,
we have the ability to send

90
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,420
a ton load of requests in a very short
amount of time with relative ease.

91
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Now, for this purpose today, you won't
actually need to install anything.

92
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,020
Rather, instead we are going to be using a
built in, well, not a built-in tool, but,

93
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,620
rather, instead a tool
that comes preinstalled.

94
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,380
It's called hping3.

95
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,410
It used to be called just hping,
but now it's hping3.

96
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,790
And let's just take a look
at the help menu to see

97
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,250
what sort of options do we have here.

98
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,680
We will be using the SYN flag,
so we'll be doing the SYN flood.

99
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,650
You also have all these other things.

100
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,830
Feel free to check these flags out.

101
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,550
You can flood the server
with all sorts of requests.

102
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,870
That's one of the bright sides,

103
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,385
that's one of the good things about
this tool that you can, okay.

104
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:23,210
If one flood doesn't work, try another.

105
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,070
If that one doesn't work, okay.

106
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,230
Try another.

107
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,330
Something is bound to work.

108
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,000
Not because the web servers are poorly
built or something of a kind.

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,490
Rather, instead, a lot of the time
people just don't have the sufficient

110
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,630
capital or something of a kind,
to invest in the security because

111
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,610
you know a security expert for a web
server, somebody to fend off attacks and

112
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,820
to tighten down security
that costs a lot of money.

113
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:57,137
Not everybody is going to be willing
to invest and alot I've seen invest,

114
00:06:57,137 --> 00:07:02,110
and a lot of minor sites unfortunately,
I see that it's pretty sad,

115
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,002
that competition is actually paying
to take down their competitive

116
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:12,110
site during Christmas or during some
holidays or something of a kind.

117
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,510
Yeah, that's definitely not a good thing.

118
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,510
And I strongly urge everybody who
is watching this tutorial, and

119
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,890
I do recommend it and
I do say it and so on and so forth.

120
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,980
Do not DoS attack,

121
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,210
do not perform DoS attacks on websites
you do not have permission to.

122
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,150
You can get some serious fines for
performing such,

123
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,030
for performing DoS attacks on websites
that you are not allowed to tamper with.

124
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,340
I know that I can get a bit tiring
if I mention in between tutorials,

125
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,390
but believe it is
important I would hate for

126
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:53,210
anybody to get into trouble or
anything like that.

127
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,250
As I said we're going to
flood it with syn flags.

128
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,240
This is going to be a syn flood we
are going to pass a syn flag there and

129
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,170
up here we have the intervals somewhere,
let me just see where it is.

130
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,480
Excellent.
So it's dash i for interval.

131
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,790
This is the format.

132
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,696
So just type in dash i, then u, and
then the amount of microseconds for

133
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:16,630
how long will be that interval.

134
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,460
You definitely want to, if it can
be shorter of course, sure put it.

135
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,760
See what can work.

136
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,710
Because, I don't know, some servers,

137
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:31,380
if they see too many requests in too short
of an interval, they will block you.

138
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,900
But rest assure,
you can route this through proxy chains.

139
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,280
And if you route it through proxy
chains or through a VPN, or

140
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,660
something like that,
you can keep on rotating the IP addresses.

141
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,820
So they continuously have to
put bans on IP addresses.

142
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,470
And that's not, they can't put permanent
bans on IP addresses because that's

143
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,740
not a very smart thing to do.

144
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,820
As they will disable
other people's Windows IP

145
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,980
addresses are reassigned
from accessing their site.

146
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,920
Rather instead IP addresses will get
locked out for a couple of days or

147
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,720
something like that.

148
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,900
Then you will need to change it or
something of a kind.

149
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,870
But if we just go down below,
clear the screen and there we go.

150
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,740
So, hping.
There we go.

151
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,870
Here is the time interval.

152
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,510
Here is the sin flag and here,
you can even tune the port and

153
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,510
then you type in the IP address.

154
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,790
You do need the IP address.

155
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,540
I have shown you all how you can get
the IP addresses from domain names and

156
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,780
I've shown you all how to get a IP
address off your default gateway.

157
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,580
Just type route.

158
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,040
I'll just show it to you
one more time just in case.

159
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,590
Route, and here you can get IP address
of your default gateway which will be

160
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,290
your router.

161
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,490
That shouldn't be a problem to acquire.

162
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,230
Anyway, go ahead and clear the screen,
go back to this command.

163
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,970
If you've typed it in excellent.

164
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,989
So, you have hping3 -i u100 -S -p and

165
00:09:55,989 --> 00:10:00,360
then space and IP address.

166
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,450
Very simple there.

167
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,190
No, complex things.

168
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,200
Nothing of a kind.

169
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,250
All though this does support some
sort of regular expressions.

170
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,160
And you can type,
you can combine this with barscripts and

171
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,420
type in something extremely complex here.

172
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:18,160
Which is not something you really need.

173
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,890
The main thing you would
really need is for

174
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:26,870
it to jump from one IP address to another
or to flood different servers at a time.

175
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,460
So for example, you're DoSing one server.

176
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,257
I don't know from 3 to 5 and then from
5 to 7 your DoSing another server.

177
00:10:34,257 --> 00:10:37,390
So these are also some
tricks that you can have.

178
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,260
I decided not to show it here,
you can find it online if you wish.

179
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
I would switch it but

180
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,210
the reason why i didn't show it here, how
to switch from one server to the other.

181
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,940
It is highly unlikely.

182
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,880
I cannot explain to you how
unlikely is it that you will have

183
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,370
enough bandwidth to actually perform this,
and if you do

184
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,240
need to switch from one server, cuz these
attacks, they don't work straight away.

185
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,650
You do need to wait for
a while for it to take effect.

186
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,845
I will show this to you.

187
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:14,321
Here, let me just open up my Windows
machine and open up Explorer.

188
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:18,123
It doesn't really matter which browser
you use, this is gonna work universally.

189
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:23,540
So, 192.168.1.1,
this is my router web server site,

190
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,481
so it's prompting me to log in
with my username and password,

191
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:32,010
so if I say cancel It's
gonna throw me here.

192
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,230
It says protected object.

193
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,410
The object on the RomPager server is
protected, and I can't access it.

194
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,690
But it doesn't matter, I can't access the
interior but I can still access the site.

195
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,900
It still prompts me for a log in,
which means that the site is functional.

196
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,160
I can log in, no problems.

197
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,820
There is no need to login now,
so I just won't.

198
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,250
But it doesn't really matter.

199
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,520
On your own home routers, feel free to
login and then perform a DoS attack.

200
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,244
It's gonna work in exactly the same way.

201
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:57,530
Now, I'm doing this in LAN.

202
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,850
But this attack is, as I said,
viable on the internet as well.

203
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,220
Over the internet, as well, no problems.

204
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,890
Now that we have proved that this site is
functional, let's just start the flood.

205
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,270
And you can see the flood is in progress.

206
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,660
The DoS attack is in progress.

207
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,790
And if I go back to
the Windows 8.1 machine.

208
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,550
Spoiler, this is still not gonna work.

209
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,858
So, if I reload it's gonna prompt me for
a username and password.

210
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,965
We can wait.
We can give it a minute or two, or

211
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:29,791
something of a kind for
the attack to actually take effect.

212
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,610
Let me just open up Firefox and
my physical machine as well.

213
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,020
It's like 192.168.1.1.

214
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:43,630
Excellent, so, I am prompted with
a username and a password here.

215
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:51,480
And you can see even in our local
area network we still have to wait.

216
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,970
Imagine if this was over the net or
something of a kind.

217
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,316
Take way longer.
You can see how

218
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,810
fast the requests are being generated.

219
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,021
It's just transmitting one after
the other, one after the other,

220
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:04,040
one after the other.

221
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,590
The intervals are ridiculously short.

222
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,080
And it should start
working any moment now.

223
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,480
Let me just try refreshing the site.

224
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,470
No, it doesn't.

225
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,420
Okay, so,
I'm just gonna call the tutorial here.

226
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,570
I'm gonna let it run for a while,
and then I am gonna come back.

227
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,630
I'm not gonna change anything.

228
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,100
If I do I will let you know, but all that
I'm doing is cutting the tutorial here.

229
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,550
I'm gonna let it run for a while and then
I'll come back just to show you that you

230
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,339
can no longer access the site, and you can
no longer get this Error message, that you

231
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:38,927
can no longer get the login,that you will
no longer be able to login or do anything

232
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:43,620
of a kind, so this is already saying, it's
waiting so lets just see if we need to.

233
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,892
Yes, so I do need to actually cut
the tutorial just not the bore you

234
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:52,395
while this is running, anyway I'll
see you in a couple of minutes and

235
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:54,200
we will see what happened.

236
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,760
So, here I am.

237
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,977
Back in my,
well not back in my virtual machine,

238
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:04,300
but back into my physical machine but
my virtual machine is here.

239
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,110
Let me just unlock it.

240
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,640
I've allowed it to run for
like 15, 20 minutes and

241
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,109
I've realized what the problem was, why
it didn't actually perform a DoS attack.

242
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:20,037
It did.
It did, but take into consideration that

243
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:24,971
this is a virtual machine and
it's resources are limited.

244
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:29,922
So when I'm recording, my physical
machine pretty much prevents this

245
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:34,720
DoS attack while I'm recording
because I take up a lot of resources.

246
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,700
And you can actually,
let me just show you this here.

247
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:48,406
Excellent, so you see that the VLC
that I am using to record is

248
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:53,040
using 222%,
while virtual box is using 84, 86.

249
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,496
And when I am not recording, VirtualBox
will be using, it will usually be

250
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:03,869
around 140, if I'm doing something
serious or something of a kind.

251
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,824
And, just to show you, see, it says,

252
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:12,300
I have gone to 192.168.1.1,
it says problem loading page.

253
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,180
So, the connection was reset,
it won't be able to actually access it.

254
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,240
But since I am recording now and
my resources are reallocated,

255
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,130
if I reload this, you see there is
still a problem with reloading.

256
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:25,650
While I connect it.

257
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,150
Oops.

258
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,300
Not that one.

259
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,508
Let me just see if I am
connected to this thing.

260
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:35,835
google.com.

261
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:39,210
Oh, actually,
I've allowed it to run for so

262
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,810
long it blocked pretty much everything
out, which is a bit awkward.

263
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,500
Let me just go back to Kali and stop this.

264
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,200
Come on.

265
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,970
Any time now.

266
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,590
It says 63% packet loss.

267
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,438
Okay.
Not bad,

268
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:59,420
considering that I've
pretty much overwhelmed it.

269
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,510
It was unable to load the site,
but now I'm just gonna disconnect.

270
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,150
And, come on.

271
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,240
Now reconnect.

272
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,290
Please.

273
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,528
Excellent, so you've managed to
disconnect, and connect again.

274
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:20,714
There we go.

275
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,315
Let's try it again.

276
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:27,580
Okay, so it is prompting me for a username
and a password, so it does work.

277
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,900
Look, basic logic behind what I did, what
I can't actually show you directly now is,

278
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,320
as I said before, while this attack
is running, if I'm recording,

279
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,000
there is simply not enough resources on
my computer to actually perform both.

280
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,420
And physical machine will
always be the priority.

281
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,540
If you run this and you're not recording
or doing anything else in the background,

282
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,470
it will work.

283
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,170
It will actually DoS your router.

284
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:58,320
As you see, it says problem loading
site because when I started recording,

285
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,400
I saw that it loaded it, and

286
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,460
when I stopped recording I saw
that it actually didn't load it.

287
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,908
So there is a difference because VLC for
recording uses quite a bit of resources,

288
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:11,130
especially CPU time.

289
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,850
Anyway this was one example.

290
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,830
I strongly encourage you to
try it out on your own so

291
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,380
you see that this is
the command that I have used.

292
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,920
It works on my router,
see if it works on yours.

293
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,830
You can also set up a server of your own
if you wish either on a Windows machine or

294
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,370
a Lenox machine or whatever.

295
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,070
These things are absolutely free.

296
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:37,100
If you need help there, please feel
free to contact me in the discussions,

297
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,890
post a question or something of a kind.

298
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,050
I'll be more than happy to help you.

299
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,400
One key note that I would like to
make at the end of this tutorial

300
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,520
is that you shouldn't
just message me directly,

301
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,280
rather instead just post it
in the discussion section.

302
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,060
And there the discussion can continue and
I can answer it as well.

303
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,460
And other people can see
what you have asked.

304
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,200
So, if they've encountered
the same problem they can see

305
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,940
the possible solutions.

306
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,550
They can say, for example,
I've tried this, that, that, didn't work.

307
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,550
And then I can immediately
give them a third or

308
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,860
fourth solution which
is more likely to work.

309
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,140
Anyway, as I said, try this attack.

310
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,060
You'll see that it most likely will
work depending on your router.

311
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,310
I don't know if you have some sort of
a Cisco router or Juniper router or

312
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,250
something like that, high tech.

313
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,070
Maybe it won't work, but since you're
in LAN, I'm pretty sure that it will,

314
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,090
primarily because you have a lot
of bandwidth to flood it with.

315
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:37,020
Anyway, I bid you all farewell, and I hope
to see you in the follow-up tutorial.
