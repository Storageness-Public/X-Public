00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,000
Today I will show you how you can install aircrack and reaver.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,300
So aircrack is pretty simple.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:16,500
Just type in "yum install aircrack-ng"

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
and its gonna pick up the right version by default, so just go ahead and press ENTER

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,890
In Fedora, it runs through checks every time you call yum.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,300
You can pass -c argument and order that to do that it.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,800
It says package aircrack-ng is already installed and latest version.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,200
You might be prompted for a question along the way.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,000
If you want to skip that, just go ahead and type in " -y"

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,840
That's it

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,500
With this command that I am selecting at the moment, installation will fly through.

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,320
You won't be prompted for any questions

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,200
and you will have aircrack-ng installed on your system without any problems.

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,539
However, Reaver is quite a different story.

16
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,800
Reaver cannot be found in Fedora's repositories and therefore, it has to be downloaded from the net.

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,200
Now the there are lots of places to do this.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,000
I have chosen to download it from Google Code.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,300
That's basically the safest place from where you can download it

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,200
and let's just go ahead open up my favorite browser, which is Firefox.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,580
You can open whatever you wish.

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,800
Type in "reaver google code"

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,000
It should pop up

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,700
Yep, this is it

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,800
There we go

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,600
Now we are on Google Code website, where we have Reaver VPS

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,000
You have a description here, and you have a pro version here.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,800
Basically the difference between the pro version and the one that we're getting for free

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,100
is this graphical user interface

30
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,700
which, I mean, let's face it

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,300
if you're pen tester or a white hat hacker, you're not going to be using that much of guis

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,409
I mean, pretty much not at all.

33
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:08,300
This just means that it's gonna try pins in a certain order

34
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,500
which is more likely to succeed than the default one, according to someone

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,300
but not necessarily true

36
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,800
and integrated WEP cracking

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,100
and as I said, you don't really need WEP

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,200
You're not gonna be able to find these days, pretty much anywhere.

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,500
If you do, as I said before, those people don't deserve to have wifi.

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,600
It's basically open wifi

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,050
regardless of what sort of a password you put in.

42
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,500
Make sure you're not one of those people.

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,400
I mean, fine, okay

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,900
somebody's going to be able to connect your network and all that

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,300
but it opens up a route for a lot worse activity, something more malicious.

46
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,900
Let's put it so they'll be able to reroute your traffic and do stuff of a kind

47
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,200
and sniff it.

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,000
Not a good idea.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Just switch to WPA or WPA2

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and click on Downloads, in the upper left corner

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,300
and there are different versions here that can be downloaded.

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:25,900
I mean, there are no fundamental differences in the way the reaver works in between these versions

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,800
but there are bugs fixes definitely in that, and that is very nice.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,000
It is maintained

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,700
There is support for it, and so on.

56
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:40,000
So just go ahead and click on reaver 1.4.tar.gz

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,500
and it says  reaver 1.4.tar.gz here, file description, etc.

58
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,800
This is the check sum

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,300
You can use this in order to verify is your file intact, but I'm not gonna do that now.

60
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm just go ahead and download it.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,600
Once it is downloaded, you can go ahead and open up the folder in which it actually exists

62
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,500
and I have a lot of things here.

63
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,800
So it says I have different versions that I have downloaded from different sites

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,600
but if you find this package that I am selecting for you at the moment

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,000
it says reaver 1.4 fc20

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The letters are pretty small.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is maximum that I can zoom it in.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,200
Don't download it

69
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,160
It doesn't work that well at all

70
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,400
It tends to break and the .rpm extension doesn't work quite as you would expect it to work.

71
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Just download it from Google Code and compile it from source.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,800
There's no reason why not do it, especially when you have me showing you in detail how to do it.

73
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,500
So just go ahead and double click on this file.

74
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,500
You can extract it through a GUI method.

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,700
It's far simpler.

76
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,100
You can also extract it through the terminal

77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,000
but I'm just gonna go ahead and use GUI for this occasion.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is one of the advantages of Linux over Windows.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,600
By default, it will be able to unpack pretty much anything.

80
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:21,500
Zip, tar, WinRar, whatever it's going to be able to unpack it, no problem

81
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,250
which is fantastic.

82
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,100
No extra insulation needed; this is all installed by default.

83
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,500
So let's just go ahead and click on extract.

84
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,300
Now where do I want to extract?

85
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,200
Let's say to desktop because I'm gonna delete it anyway

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,300
as I already do have it installed.

87
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:49,000
So just go ahead and press Okay

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,900
and yeah, I've just told it to do it twice. Oh well.

89
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,000
Apply to all, override

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,700
We're not going to lose a lot of time there, as the extraction process is relatively fast.

91
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, so let's just go ahead and go back to our terminal

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
navigate over to desktop

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
"cd /home/Chronic/Desktop/

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,200
and do I have it here?

95
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
Yep, there we go.

96
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,000
"clear"

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let me just show you that I do in fact have it.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,190
It's much neater if I do it like this

99
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,100
and there we go.

100
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,800
reaver-1.4/

101
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,190
Let's navigate over to that folder.

102
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,700
reaver-1.4/

103
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:54,000
Clear the screen, list the contents of the directory, go to docs

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,200
Let's just go ahead and  see what is there

105
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,330
and you might think that I'm some sort of an expert or something of a kind

106
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,500
that I just do these things out of my head.

107
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,400
No. People create readme files for a reason.

108
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:16,500
They are there to be read, because the developer has left specific instructions on how to do something.

109
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,000
So let's just go ahead and cat it.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,200
Excellent

111
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,500
So the following are Reaver source files.

112
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,600
So it has the description of what is located in each one of these files

113
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,700
So you have 80211.c

114
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,400
Functions for reading, sending, and parsing 802.11 management frames

115
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
802.11 is a standard, as I said before

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
but look at this --

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The developer has actually left the entire installation process here.

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You have every single command that you need to run explained in detail

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,919
what it does, and how you can open and execute it.

120
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,500
This is wonderful

121
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,000
and that is why I say when you download something, when you unzip it

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,400
just go ahead and find the readme file.

123
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
It's there for a reason.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,900
People do tend to leave instructions there on how to do something

125
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,000
and they most likely encounter the same problems that you might have encountered.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,100
So you can even see possible solutions.

127
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,000
Anyway, you can check this inscription out.

128
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,400
Uh...Not inscription, but the text.

129
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:58,000
Reaver is only supported on the Linux platform, requires the libpcap and libsqlite librarie

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,500
and can be built and installed by running the following commands

131
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,500
and so execute the configuration script, make, make install

132
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,000
That's it

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,170
It even tells you how to actually install it.

134
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,600
So they're there for a reason.

135
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Anyway, of course you cannot run the configuration file from here.

136
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,630
You need to reverse course and go to source

137
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,900
Let's see what's in there...

138
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,600
There we go

139
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,150
We have configure

140
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,000
and you can see by default here, it's executable.

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,500
If I just give you a longer listing

142
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,000
It has an x permission here, here, and here.

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,940
So the user has it, and the group has it as well.

144
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:59,500
Anyway, type in "./configure"

145
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,200
So now it's checking for stuff.

146
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,200
It has it's dependencies, without which it cannot function.

147
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Type in "make"

148
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,200
There we go

149
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,400
It's running through

150
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,800
So I didn't do anything out of my head here.

151
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,200
I just went on the web, I found the safest place I can find to download the code from

152
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,600
and I'm compiling it here, as the developer of the code instructed me to do it

153
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,070
and the instructions aren't that complicated.

154
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,400
It's just three commands

155
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,200
and the final command is "make install"

156
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Now it's gonna give me a lot of errors here...

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,600
Well, not errors, but warnings

158
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:54,240
primarily because I already have it installed.

159
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,000
I need to clear this out and then be able to install this

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,200
but that's not gonna happen, primarily because I do have reaver installed.

161
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:13,800
So let's just go ahead and check one more time if there is anything else that we've left out.

162
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,410
If I can reach it

163
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,200
Yep, there we go.

164
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
So no, I haven't left anything out.

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,300
Basically, the last command for you will run.

166
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,700
For me, it won't

167
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,700
primarily because I already have reaver installed on my system.

168
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,500
If there are any problems, feel free to post it in the question section.

169
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,800
I will be more than happy to help you out.

170
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,200
Let's go ahead and clear this out.

171
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,900
So type in "reaver --help"

172
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,600
Excellent

173
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,300
It is installed, it is functional, it is responsive to our commands

174
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,000
and here's the syntax for reaver.

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,600
This is the basic syntax.

176
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,500
Of course you can pass all of these arguments through it

177
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
and there are quite a lot of them.

178
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,200
Basically what you say is "-i" for network interfaceand "-b" for BSSID

179
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,500
Over the MAC address, put quite simply.

180
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,700
For the MAC address here, you have it.

181
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,300
This is just a sample MAC address that has been generically placed here

182
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,000
and of course, we have even for reaver

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
-vv for double verbose output, which is fantastic.

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,300
Let's just go ahead and clear the screen.

185
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,800
That was a way in which you could have installed aircrack and reaver in Linux

186
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,600
but just in case you are a Windows user, I'll show you how to do it in Windows.

187
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
Until then, I bid you farewell.
