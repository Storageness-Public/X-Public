1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,084
Welcome back all

2
00:00:02,084 --> 00:00:06,183
Today we're gonna go ahead and set up a VPN in

3
00:00:06,183 --> 00:00:08,080
Kali Linux 2.0

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,437
I am using a virtual machine

5
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:14,814
If you're not it doesn't really matter

6
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:18,509
the procedure is pretty much the same

7
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:20,960
so it doesn't matter which operating system

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,685
is running as your host

9
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:26,589
I'm running a Fedora as my host but,

10
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:30,526
it doesn't really matter if it's Windows or Mac or whatever else

11
00:00:30,526 --> 00:00:32,780
there might be out there,

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,049
completely irrelevant

13
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:35,661
just have a,

14
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:39,497
as long as the virtual machine is functional, it should work

15
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:43,530
Anyway, if you're using a virtual machine, go to devices,

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,501
and network, network settings and make sure that

17
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:50,061
these settings that we've talked about

18
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:53,393
are proper, so it doesn't necessarily need

19
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:57,496
to be in bridge mode, but I'm using bridge mode

20
00:00:57,496 --> 00:00:59,955
I'm using a bridged adapter,

21
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:03,323
so here it says, name,

22
00:01:03,323 --> 00:01:06,007
this is the interface that you are using

23
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:09,881
so no big deal, just take a look on your

24
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:12,146
host system which interface you are using

25
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:14,616
and then select here if you don't know,

26
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,827
if you're too lazy to check it,

27
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:22,045
they are usually or have maximum three or something like that,

28
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:25,295
maybe a little bit more, I'll just try one after another

29
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:27,371
if you can't really bother to check,

30
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:28,697
but

31
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:32,370
that should be, that should be pretty self-explanatory

32
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,393
I've talked about this in the previous tutorials

33
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:38,741
Anyway, in down, down in the ''Advanced''

34
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:41,801
make sure that the promiscuous mode is allowed all

35
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,533
and that is pretty much it, actually there isn't

36
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:46,873
that much else that you need to do,

37
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:50,800
just go ahead and click on ''ok''

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,416
So now that I have the virtual machine up and running

39
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,694
I'm gonna go ahead and open up the terminal

40
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:01,468
Let's go ahead and zoom in a little bit

41
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:08,749
and one of the very first things that we're going to do

42
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:11,574
is change our DNS settings because I've noticed that

43
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:16,213
people can't do and follow through certain things in the tutorial

44
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:20,432
because they're using some really weird DNS servers

45
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:24,662
and those DNS servers are basically blocking you

46
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:29,405
as they are doing traffic filtration or something like that

47
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:39,530
so if you do ''cat /etc/resolv.conf"

48
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:46,886
you can see which DNS servers you're using

49
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:50,269
so I'm using the one provided by my ISP

50
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,363
so I'm just choosing my router,

51
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:54,659
basically my home gateway,

52
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:00,666
you have 99% chance that this is the same,

53
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,736
that you have the same as mine

54
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:07,481
and this is basically forwarding the traffic to my ISP from where

55
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:12,805
from who has a DNS server and there I can actually get

56
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:15,828
my queries resolved, but

57
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,772
we don't really want that because there's a lot

58
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:21,678
I mean not always but certainly in a lot of cases

59
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:24,510
there's a lot of filtration on those DNS servers

60
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,594
so we will change that

61
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:30,019
Let's go ahead and just clear the screen and

62
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:34,229
type in "vim"

63
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:35,474
Let me see if vim is installed

64
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:36,081
it is

65
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:40,691
Excellent

66
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:41,633
"clear"

67
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:47,682
type in "vim /", actually you know what?

68
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:51,637
Let's just use nano, it'll be a lot simpler for you

69
00:03:51,637 --> 00:04:01,781
"nano /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf"

70
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:04,338
Press Enter

71
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:07,661
Scroll down with the mouse scroll or with an arrow

72
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,505
which way you prefer

73
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:12,597
And let's see where is that line

74
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:20,550
Ok, so, this one that says "prepend domain name servers"

75
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:25,492
Let's go ahead and remove that, delete that

76
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:30,502
and here we are going to type in our new name servers

77
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:32,014
so, what should it be?

78
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:34,940
Well I'll just go on to the net

79
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,619
No big deal

80
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:45,609
Also, you can choose a DNS server which is not in your own country

81
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:48,403
That is sometimes a good idea as well

82
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:52,615
I am going to use Open DNS, I have been using it and you're pretty good

83
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:54,543
and you're pretty safe

84
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:58,698
as far as I know and as far as my experience goes

85
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:04,606
so, open DNS, you definitely have other ones that are available

86
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:07,147
up there

87
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:08,837
Open DNS IP addresses

88
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:10,773
that's what we need

89
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,676
and there we go, so these are two IP addresses

90
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:18,367
which we are going to use

91
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:34,386
by the way if you're wondering how I am doing this

92
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:39,339
you know the button in Windows that you press for start?

93
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,751
It's in between Control and Alt, it has a Windows sign on it?

94
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:47,488
So if you press that button it's gonna split the screen

95
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:50,299
into multiple windows

96
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:52,028
that's something from the unix shell

97
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,906
so go ahead and paste one IP address here

98
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:04,933
then type in a coma and a space and then take the second IP address

99
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:09,793
and let's go back to the terminal

100
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:16,872
it's a virtual machine, in the real machine you can actually tap the upper left corner

101
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:21,555
twice or once with a mouse and this will happen as well

102
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:26,742
Ok, so, there we go

103
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:28,842
Control + O to save

104
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:29,886
Press Enter

105
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:33,547
and then press Control + X to exit

106
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:47,736
now we need to type in "service network-manager restart"

107
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:53,397
Now we're gonna do "cat /etc/resolv.conf"

108
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:54,945
and here we go

109
00:06:54,945 --> 00:07:02,850
So I have this one, I have this one, and then I have the ISP down at the bottom

110
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,433
Now there's a way of removing this one at the bottom as well

111
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:10,815
but this is almost never going to get used

112
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:14,636
I mean the second one is almost is never going to get used

113
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:19,078
unless there's some load balancing on Open DNS and between the two IP addresses

114
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:26,183
but the third one, very, very rarely will it actually be used.

115
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:29,414
So, yeah, no worries there

116
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:37,265
If you want to be like 100% safe you can go back to this file

117
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:43,370
and then add a third address and then only those three will be used

118
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,551
because by default only three can be used

119
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:51,954
you can have one main and two file saves and I'm going to go ahead

120
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:55,754
and type in, I'm gonna go a used the Google one

121
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:58,938
but you can use whichever one you want

122
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:01,126
I'm just using an example here

123
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:05,998
I prefer to use Open DNS and you can definitely find some

124
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:11,635
fairly anonymous DNS servers out there on the net

125
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:15,462
please, please please, be careful

126
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:19,611
once you find a DNS server, go on to the forums and see what people have

127
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:21,354
been saying about those DNS servers.

128
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:23,356
What is their reputation like?

129
00:08:23,356 --> 00:08:30,014
Do they protect, do they do something mischievous or something like that?

130
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,235
Is it like fake thing that just happen stumbled across the net

131
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:38,718
promising you a lot of things but delivering nothing

132
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:43,455
and just redirecting you to some advertisement site? or redirecting you

133
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:48,357
to malicious sites? so just be very careful with that and make sure

134
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:53,516
that you select the reputable ones

135
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:58,006
Anyway, just go ahead and press Control + O to save as before

136
00:08:58,006 --> 00:08:58,602
Enter

137
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:00,194
Extracts it

138
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:04,214
and then we just need to restart the network manager again

139
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:10,212
no big deal, now we can go ahead and "cat /etc/resolv.conf"

140
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:16,272
and you can see that we have one, two, three, and you have a note

141
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:22,341
"the libc resolver may not support more than three nameservers"

142
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:26,260
"the nameservers listed below may not be recognized"

143
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,652
Actually they won't be recognized

144
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:35,238
Just list these three as an example, but you can take a DNS server from anywhere

145
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:42,476
on this planet earth, so for example, if you are in the U.S, if you are in Japan

146
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:48,609
or if you are in China or in Germany or something like that, you don't necessarily need to choose

147
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:55,065
a DNS server from that country, you can choose a DNS server from some other country

148
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:04,474
So if you're using a VPN or proxies, if you're using proxies specially

149
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:07,796
you don't want to afford any DNS, basically

150
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:14,041
somebody sees... I'm confusing you a little bit here

151
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:20,116
If you are using a proxy, then let's say that you are in France,

152
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:24,006
and then you are using a proxy from Germany, so it appears as

153
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,642
though your traffic is coming from Germany,

154
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:31,455
but your DNS server is still in France, so somebody might infer from that

155
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:34,901
that you are from France

156
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,996
Therefore, if you choose a DNS server in Germany as well

157
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:42,670
your proxy and your DNS both match Germany

158
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,018
but you can choose some DNS server from another country

159
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:52,126
Let's say: Finland, so you can have a Finnish DNS server and you can have a

160
00:10:52,126 --> 00:11:01,473
german IP address on the net, that way somebody cannot conclude from which

161
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:05,543
country you are coming from and that is a pretty good thing

162
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:12,713
Another note is that DNS servers by default, they don't log queries

163
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:21,165
but , I mean, it would be a massive operation to log all the daily queries

164
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:24,940
maybe somebody does it, I don't know, I cannot guarantee it to you

165
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:32,256
I know that the DNS servers by default, the ones that you can install the DNS server and configure it

166
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:35,633
and then you will see that by default it doesn't log queries,

167
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:38,088
but you know, somebody might set it up, or something like that

168
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:42,208
might happen, so be very, very careful which DNS servers are you using

169
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:48,409
Use the ones that give have a good standing reputation and you can also

170
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:53,345
use the ones in countries which have a good standing reputation in terms of

171
00:11:53,345 --> 00:12:03,131
respecting user privacy, for example, Netherlands is one very good example

172
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:07,698
Sweden as well, it's pretty good there and there are some European countries

173
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:11,822
and countries worldwide that I can't think of now at the moment but it doesn't really matter

174
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:16,780
you can look this up on the net, the information is widely available

175
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:22,149
so where, from which countries can you choose the DNS servers and which DNS servers

176
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:26,048
you choose, now I've also... I'm sorry, I'm sorry for making this lengthy,

177
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:33,581
but I do want to explain a couple of points here before I wrapped it up and then go into the VPN set up itself

178
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:43,680
Yeah, I have people before who stated that they had problems when they changed the DNS and then

179
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,018
they've changed the DNS and then they used the VPN and the DNS still shows that

180
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:54,518
their DNS is in the US, well yes, because the DNS server you selected

181
00:12:54,518 --> 00:13:01,039
is actually from the US so if you choose another one from another country elsewhere in the world

182
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,231
it will just show that the DNS is in that country, so you actually don't have a DNS leak

183
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:12,681
it's just that IP address in that DNS server is physically located in the country

184
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:18,188
of your origin, so if you choose another one you will be fine

185
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:21,825
Anyway, in the follow-up tutorial, I'm running a little bit short of time

186
00:13:21,825 --> 00:13:24,649
so in the follow-up tutorial we'll just gonna go ahead and continue with this

187
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:29,738
download the files we need to download and connect to the VPN service.
