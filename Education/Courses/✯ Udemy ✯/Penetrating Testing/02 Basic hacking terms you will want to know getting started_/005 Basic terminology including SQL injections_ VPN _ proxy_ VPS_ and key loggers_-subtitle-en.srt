1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everybody and welcome to this
tutorial.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,900
Here, I'm just gonna continue from where I left off in the previous one.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,540
If you have not seen the previous tutorial, I
strongly urge you to do so

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,400
as the two are closely interrelated, so to say.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,600
Anyway, previously we discussed some of these things

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,200
such as DoS, RAT, fishing and so on and so forth.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,320
But here, I wanna go a step further

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:35,000
and tell you about SQL injections, VPNs, 
proxies, Tor, VPS, key loggers

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and so on and so forth.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,400
You will see how all these things will
play a role later on

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,700
throughout the course.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,739
But for the time being

13
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:49,300
you have SQL injections, which are simply passing SQL queries to HTTP requests.

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,800
If they are not properly formatted by the PHP code on the server side

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,700
this can present a serious problem

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,850
and this is always one of the primary
considerations

17
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,300
of all the web developers out there.

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,449
Later on I will demonstrate how you can use these

19
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:06,640
formulate them

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,700
and there is a large amount of websites that are vulnerable out there

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,000
primarily because the frameworks on which they're based

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,500
are vulnerable as well.

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,100
Next up, you have Virtual Private Networks

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,300
so VPNs

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,300
These are ways of anonymizing yourselves.

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,409
Basically, if you have a VPN provider somewhere

27
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:32,200
and if you want you anonymize yourself

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,619
you will route all their traffic through this VPN provider

29
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:41,100
and all the traffic between you and the VPN provider will be heavily encrypted.

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,800
So any other server out there

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,759
if it is receiving requests from you

32
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,170
it is actually receiving them from VPN.

33
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:55,900
There is no real way of detecting you or fighting your physical location

34
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,500
unless the VPN provider actually gives it up.

35
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,300
which doesn't really happen if you pick the right one.

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,100
Down below you have proxies.

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,900
Now proxies are a less reliable way of staying anonymous

38
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:15,900
but you should always make it your common practice to use Socks5 proxies.

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,000
I will explain what these are

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,600
I will introduce them when we do proxy chains

41
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,900
and when I explain to you how you can
actually stay anonymous

42
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,600
while conducting these sort of activities.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,300
You will realize that you can route your connection through several proxies

44
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,970
but very soon you will see as well, that doesn't always work.

45
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,100
In the movies or something like that you see people going through 10

46
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,700
or 20 different proxies.

47
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,400
In reality that would be very VERY difficult to implement

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,400
primarily because of internet speeds

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,100
because of the available bandwidth.

50
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,000
Most of the free proxies out there are not very fast

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,100
and routing your connection through several of them

52
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:05,800
will make it very difficult for you to do anything in a reasonable amount of time.

53
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
There are, of course, paid proxies

54
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,000
but when you pay a proxy, you leave digital footprints somewhere

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,290
so you can be traced.

56
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,900
Down below, you have Tor.

57
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,079
Now Tor is absolutely free open source

58
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,799
and it's much faster than proxies.

59
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:25,840
It's not faster than VPNs, but it is faster than proxies.

60
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,980
It gives you the ability to torify your applications

61
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:37,200
which in essence, means simply routing
traffic through certain routes

62
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,430
and using certain routers on the Internet to
actually

63
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,000
not just routers, but using certain devices
on the Internet for your packets

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,500
for your connection to go through.

65
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,600
It can be slow from time to time.

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
It is not a 100% guarantee

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,200
but you will be anonymous to a very large extent

68
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,300
if you are using Tor.

69
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,000
There are ways of detecting you

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,800
but they are HIGHLY unlikely to happen Nike night

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Like 99.99% of time, you will be almost 100% anonymous

72
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,400
which is a very good way of functioning.

73
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,289
Also, you have the Tor browser

74
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,300
which allows you to access dark web, or hidden web

75
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,000
however you wish to call it.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,600
Basically, those are ".onion" websites

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,840
and they are not indexed by any other search engines out there

78
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,000
and they cannot be accessed by a regular internet route...

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,800
from the regular internet browsing perspective.

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,490
You cannot...I mean if you open up Firefox

81
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,600
and if you had your internet connection

82
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,800
and if you don't have your internet connection configured in a proper way

83
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,300
to connect it to a network, or something of a kind

84
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:56,800
you will not be able to access any of the hidden webs, dark webs, website services

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
and so on and so forth.

86
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,300
Now I will also show you how to access dark web and how to use it

87
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,000
as it has a vast amount of resources that are at your disposal

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,900
most of them free

89
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,400
some of them paid, and so on and so forth.

90
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,600
Down below, you have VPS.

91
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,180
These are Virtual Private Servers.

92
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,100
It is a method of...

93
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,400
it is a security...

94
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,150
it can viewed as a security layer.

95
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,950
For example, if you have an Apache server
running on your physical machine

96
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,300
you can have a virtual machine within
that physical machine

97
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,300
which will serve as an SQL Server for that Apache server.

98
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,830
This is done so that the SQL server cannot be accessed from outside

99
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,150
and that you don't have an SQL port open
on your physical machine.

100
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,800
So only devices

101
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,310
only programs

102
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,650
and users from that particular machine

103
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,200
will be able to access to virtual machine where the SQL Server is.

104
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,550
A bit of back and forth action here.

105
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,100
It might sound unclear or something like that

106
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,210
but I don't want you to worry about it now.

107
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,700
When I show the  examples when you get into it

108
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,400
you will understand it.

109
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,200
I guarantee it to you.

110
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,300
So no problems there.

111
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,100
Here I'm just introducing you to the terminology

112
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,100
and giving you an idea of what's to come.

113
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,800
Excellent

114
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,200
So we also have "Key Loggers"

115
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,180
which are tools that are used to steal credentials

116
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,600
and not only credentials

117
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,500
but also used to extract information.

118
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,060
If you manage to deploy a key logger on a machine

119
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,300
you can configure it to send

120
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,900
to record all keystrokes and send them to a mail address

121
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,240
to an FTP server.

122
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,200
Today, key loggers are advanced to the extent

123
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,130
that they have

124
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,200
they have like a hundred options or so

125
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,900
configurable to the fullest of extents

126
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
and you can do pretty much whatever you want with them

127
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,300
I mean, they have their basic functionalities

128
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,800
the basic functionalities are still there

129
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,389
to record the keystrokes

130
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,800
but not only do they record keystrokes

131
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
for example

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,600
they can extract existing information as well.

133
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,410
You can configure their behavior

134
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,500
how is the stealth level of the key logger?

135
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,000
How will it hide?

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,400
Where will it go?

137
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,600
Where will it be installed?

138
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,900
What sort of information do you want to extract?

139
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,200
Do you want monitor particular folders for activity

140
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,840
and you want to record it?

141
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,300
You can configure them take screenshots.

142
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,280
You can configure them to use the camera on the device

143
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,000
on which you had deployed a key logger to take a picture every five minutes

144
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,030
or something like that

145
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,600
That wouldn't be the of brightest ideas

146
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,100
because obviously somebody would that you are taking a picture

147
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,599
but those are just examples of what you
can do with them

148
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,300
and later on we will actually download the genuine keylogger

149
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,800
Install it

150
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,600
Deploy it

151
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,110
and show methods of deployment and how you can configure it as well

152
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,990
although you should be very careful from where you download your tools

153
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,800
such as key loggers, remote demonstration tools, rootkits

154
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,300
and so on and so forth.

155
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,720
Primarily because you never ever want to download

156
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,300
an uncompiled binary file that is not open source

157
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,100
because you have no way of knowing what's in it

158
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:30,300
and you absolutely NEVER want to run it on your computer

159
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,400
You might get what you want

160
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,000
you know, a key logger or something of a kind

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,800
but your computer might get infected with exactly the same key logger

162
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,500
that you planned to deploy somewhere

163
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,000
or with exactly the same wrath that you intended to deploy somewhere.

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,770
So that's a very bright idea.

165
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,860
You should use verified sources of such tools.

166
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,750
I will show a few of them later on

167
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,800
as I go over to the internet and download them

168
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,100
but I'm just making it very clear here

169
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,380
that you should be very careful with these things

170
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,900
and one of the full proof methods of doing this

171
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
is actually configuring a virtual machine

172
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,800
and doing this sort of activity on that virtual machine.

173
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,100
So even if you get infected or something of a kind

174
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,800
it doesn't matter.

175
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,100
It's a virtual machine.

176
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,300
You can reinstall it anytime you want.

177
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
Very fast

178
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,700
Pretty much no information will be lost there.

179
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,620
More importantly, the primary file system on your main physical machine

180
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,900
will not be accessed from the virtual machine

181
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,100
Anyway, down below you have the terminal

182
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,200
So terminal is basically an interface for you

183
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,200
that allows you to control your operating system.

184
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Now, Linux terminal is VERY powerful.

185
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,800
We will be using it extensively.

186
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
You will need to familiarize yourselves with it.

187
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,000
I will familiarize you with it.

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,560
I will teach how to use it.

189
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,100
To some people, it might seem a bit difficult

190
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
or a bit tricky at first sight.

191
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,100
You know, there are a lot of commands to type in --

192
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,800
How to memorize them all

193
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,000
What to use where, and so on and so forth

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,510
but believe me, there is a certain logic to it

195
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,640
and once you figure it out, everything
just flies.

196
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,700
I know by heart about 30% of possible commands out there.

197
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,190
regarding Linux terminals

198
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:35,400
and the rest I simply figure out with dash H or dash dash help.

199
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,120
The system pretty much tells you everything you need to know.

200
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,290
It helps you out to a great extent

201
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,600
and you are able to figure out a lot of
things

202
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,200
from just understanding the basic logic
of how it works

203
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
and so on.

204
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,590
Now, there will always of course be arguments

205
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,450
I don't know, maybe people saying "Why would you use terminals?"

206
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,600
"Why won't you just use GUI tools or something like that?"

207
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,500
The simple answer is because they are not as nearly as powerful

208
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,100
as the terminal tools are.

209
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,190
Plus, terminal tools have far less dependencies

210
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,300
and most the hacking tools are basically designed for the terminals.

211
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,640
They're not...they don't have GUIs.

212
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,100
A lot of do have them these days

213
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,400
but I might go over them briefly at a certain point of time

214
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,500
because it is not...

215
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,400
the GUI interfaces are not that relevant

216
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,000
When you figure out how to do it in the terminal

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,790
you will automatically, by default

218
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,850
know how to do it with the Graphical
User Interface

219
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,300
for that particular program.

220
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,360
Anyway, down below you have firewalls.

221
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,700
Now, firewall in Linux is configured through IP table commands

222
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,000
You keep on passing arguments and configuring these firewalls

223
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,210
and this is one of the main reasons

224
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,700
why you should not be using any distribution of windows

225
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,700
for this particular tutorial --

226
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,860
to follow this tutorial.

227
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,410
You will need to install

228
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,800
as I said previously

229
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,400
will need to install either a Linux virtual machine or create a duel boot

230
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,200
or something of a kind.

231
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,100
I will, of course, show how to do this and demonstrate it in great detail what are the main

232
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,900
but one of the main reasons --

233
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,700
the firewalls are one of the main reasons

234
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,600
why we can't use windows for these sort of purposes.

235
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Linux firewall is open source

236
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,700
and it has a ridiculous amount of options

237
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,000
a ridiculous amount.

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,990
Enough getting here...

239
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,000
You can do with it pretty much whatever you want.

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,100
You can configure.

241
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
You can close and open ports.

242
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,200
Forward connections via ports or via IP addresses.

243
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
You can close...

244
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,400
you can just forbid certain protocols on certain ports

245
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,300
or forbid certain protocols for certain IP addresses.

246
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,000
Do all manner of forwarding and redirection

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
and so on and so forth.

248
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,020
This all available for free with a Linux
firewall

249
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,080
While in Windows, you will have some of these options

250
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,980
but most of them you won't unless you, for example

251
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,500
buy a certain package or something like that

252
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,300
which is not something that we really want to do here.

253
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,040
We want to keep this budget-friendly

254
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,240
and we want to have a powerful firewall

255
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,200
which can do pretty much whatever we want it to do.

256
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,000
Now, there will be two ways of configuring this firewall

257
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,200
and if you are afraid of messing it up, don't worry about it

258
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,000
because most configurations that we will do will be short-lived configurations

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,700
so to say

260
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,000
primarily because all the configurations made to the firewall

261
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,500
from iptables command

262
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,700
unless specified otherwise

263
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,800
will be temporary, and they will hold until the next system reset.

264
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,760
There is a way to circumvent this, of course

265
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,500
and to configure the firewall rules in the configuration file directly

266
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,590
and thereby making the changes permanent

267
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,200
which is also one of the ways of doing  it

268
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
but I don't generally prefer it

269
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,800
I prefer it to have a script somewhere which you can run at anytime

270
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,300
and it will configure firewall by default.

271
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:24,600
This is primarily because you want to
have your tools set in a USB stick

272
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,530
or somewhere in the line

273
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,000
or something of a kind.

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,800
and you have these quick scripts, which you generate

275
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,000
and then they perform these tasks for
you in an automated fashion.

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,300
It's really simple.

277
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,000
I will show you how to make these scripts.

278
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,970
You don't need...

279
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,100
You do not necessarily need some advanced programming knowledge

280
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,000
or anything of a kind.

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Basically what these scripts are

282
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,530
are lists of Linux terminal commands

283
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,500
which we will do anyway.

284
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,560
So basically, the script would consist out of a list of those commands

285
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,300
then you just change the mod of the script to be an executable file

286
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,900
run it

287
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:07,100
and all those commands are past the system

288
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,000
and those tasks are finished in an automated fashion, by default.

289
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,900
Anyway, one of the final things that I wish to address here

290
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,000
are "Reverse-shells"

291
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,900
There are hundreds, if not thousands of reverse-shells out there

292
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,110
that you can use.

293
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,440
I will pick a few that we will use, depending on the framework

294
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,700
depending on the environment, of course, that we want to infect.

295
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,800
But in essence, what reverse-shells are

296
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
as the name itself says

297
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,400
you have a program, which you infect in another device

298
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,300
and then that program opens up a reverse connection from that device

299
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,900
back to you.

300
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,300
So you can keep on passing commands.

301
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,170
You can keep on controlling the system

302
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,100
even though you are nowhere near it. there are
different types of course today

303
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,500
There are different types, of course, today with routers

304
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,900
and so on and so forth.

305
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,040
With such firewalls, you need to do a lot of extra configuration

306
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,700
and there are problems that need to be solved and addressed.

307
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,870
You'll see how when you're trying to break into a single computer

308
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,899
sometimes you need to break into the
router first.

309
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,000
Usually you need to break into the router first

310
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,900
unless you're performing these fishing sort of attacks

311
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,700
or there's a web server, or something of a kind, running in the background

312
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,620
But attacking a private device --

313
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,300
private computer, which is usually what
people do

314
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,800
as preludes to bigger hacks

315
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,700
because they want to extract some sort of information

316
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,500
or something of a kind

317
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,200
from let's say, a company's employee that's a network administrator

318
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
or somebody like that.

319
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,300
They will...

320
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,700
One of the basic factors would be to attack a home router

321
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,439
change the DNS settings there

322
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:57,400
and try to steal credentials in such a way

323
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,800
or put the computer in the DMZ of the router

324
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,900
demilitarized zone

325
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,200
so that the router is no longer effective for the device.

326
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:12,600
Rather instead, it just forwards all traffic to that device regardless

327
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,850
So that can be...

328
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,250
Those are some of the types of attacks you can do

329
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:23,000
but reverse-shells will depend on the choice of the environment

330
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,900
that you are trying to infect

331
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:33,000
and will depend on the choice of your attack route, as well.

332
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,400
In any case, I hope that you got some basic introduction to these terms

333
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,600
and I again repeat, if you didn't figure it out all immediately

334
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,700
don't worry about it.

335
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,500
We will do all of this in great details with a lot of examples

336
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,600
and you will understand it.

337
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,350
It is not complicated.

338
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,700
Do not allow fear to dissuade or stop you.

339
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,840
Just keep on going in spite of it

340
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,890
and if you can just stick in to the end of this course

341
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,980
I guarantee it to you, you will understand it

342
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,800
with just a bit a focus and a bit of curiosity

343
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,200
you will be able to obtain the necessary skills needed

344
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,300
in order to become a pen tester or an ethical hacker.

345
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,010
I bid you all farewell and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
