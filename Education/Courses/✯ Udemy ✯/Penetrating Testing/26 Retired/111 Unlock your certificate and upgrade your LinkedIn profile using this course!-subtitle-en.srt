1
00:00:00,215 --> 00:00:03,446
One of the awesome things you get out
of taking this course

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,980
is a certificate

3
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:06,260
you can display

4
00:00:06,425 --> 00:00:08,246
online when you've completed.

5
00:00:08,963 --> 00:00:12,233
On LinkedIn you can add this
certificate to your profile

6
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:14,451
to build your online resume,

7
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:15,498
and enhance

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,290
your ability to get a job

9
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:20,193
using the skills you
have learned in this course.

10
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,541
You can add the certificate once
you've got it.

11
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:25,355
If you scroll down on editing
your profile,

12
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:28,021
you can then click on adding
a certificate,

13
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:30,153
and you can then put everything in

14
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:32,160
that you get from the certificate,
here.

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,870
Where do you get the certificate?

16
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,308
You have a bar on the top
of your course,

17
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,373
Now, since I am the instructor, it
doesn't show on this course.

18
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:42,291
You will have a bar up here,

19
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:45,450
that shows you how close
to finishing the course you are,

20
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:48,095
how many lectures you've completed
on the course,

21
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:51,956
so when you go through each lecture,
this bar will continue to fill up

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,688
and then there's a little trophy
at the end of it.

23
00:00:54,978 --> 00:00:57,908
Once you've filled the bar and
completed every lecture in the course

24
00:00:58,071 --> 00:00:59,318
you get a trophy.

25
00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:03,108
Once you clicked on the trophy,
Udemy will give you your certificate.

26
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:04,650
It will give you a certificate

27
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:06,186
you can print out

28
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,046
and it will also give you
a link online

29
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:12,500
that you can use to fill in this
information on LinkedIn

30
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:14,165
and if any employer

31
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:15,060
or

32
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:15,700
web

33
00:01:15,865 --> 00:01:19,350
platform like Upwork ask
for your certificate link,

34
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:21,568
you can give that exact link,

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,791
which will show proof that you've
completed the course on Udemy,

36
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,010
and will give you somehting tangible

37
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,018
to show that you've gotten
out of this course.

38
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:35,575
Now, if you want a shortcut,
which you're on a hacking course

39
00:01:35,738 --> 00:01:37,355
it's certainly possible, you might
want a shortcut.

40
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:41,008
On the trophy is based on clicking the
lectures.

41
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:43,371
Well, if you click on a lecture,

42
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,378
all you have to do is click on
this little

43
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:48,126
check button down here,

44
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,266
to hit mark as completed. So you hit
"Mark as completed."

45
00:01:52,598 --> 00:01:53,483
And then

46
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,960
it registers that you've completed
the lecture.

47
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:58,430
So, theoretically,

48
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:02,931
you can just go through and hit mark
as completed on every single lecture

49
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:05,238
and then get your certificate that
way.

50
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,008
Now, you might not learn anything but
that's up to you.

51
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:09,758
You can still get your certificate

52
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,256
even without watching any
lectures in the course.

53
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,961
This is helpful

54
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,970
in case you go to watch
a beginning of a lecture

55
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,908
and you decide:
"Ok, I don't need to watch

56
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:19,675
the whole thing."

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,003
You can mark it as completed
and move on.

58
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:23,903
Or if you watch say, like this

59
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:25,910
it has a little green circle on it

60
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:27,575
that means it's not completed.

61
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:29,575
You can see these lectures
are completed.

62
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:31,091
I've watched the entire

63
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:33,508
lecture on both of these.

64
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:35,075
And what you ultimately need are green
check marks

65
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,023
on every lecture on the course.

66
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:38,238
to get your trophy.

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,651
Or if you watched part of a lecture
and it didn't register as completed,

68
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:44,470
You can just go back, bring that
lecture up

69
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,141
and hit completed right away,

70
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:49,078
So that then you can bring up your
certificate.

71
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:51,166
I appreciate you watching this,

72
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:52,873
and hope this is useful for you

73
00:02:53,035 --> 00:02:54,953
in showing off what you've
learned

74
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,735
in this course, in a tangible way
that other people can see.
