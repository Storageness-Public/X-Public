1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,350
How can you get answers to your questions and help with the problems you have learning about ethical

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,430
hacking in this course.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,690
I think the most valuable part about this course are not the videos themselves.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,300
I think the community here is where you can get the most help.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,720
There are 33000 plus other students here looking to learn the same things you are doing.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,050
There are hundreds of students here with expert level experience at exactly what you're trying to learn

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:37,710
who have the ability to answer your questions in the course if you post a discussion with your question

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,760
the way hundreds of students have done before you you can get an answer every single time you post a

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,560
question.

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,780
We have people paid here to answer your questions and Erman and I check on the questions in the course

11
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,050
also and other students are looking at the course.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,460
So if you type a title for your discussion and then if you ask the question here you can count on answers

13
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:07,560
just like the people before you've got within an hour you'll see a quick question here answered within

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,060
an hour right away.

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,510
Questions down here an hour ago three replies are already questions here.

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,940
Two hours ago multi-role replies including screen shots the entire course is like this you can count

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,790
on answers to your questions and if you have some really deep technical problems where you would want

18
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,640
to do or if you want to really take it to the intermediate and advanced level try and network with some

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,760
other students in the course encourage people to send you a message so that you can chat and meet together

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,670
and get to know each other more and then build relationships.

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,560
The best examples I've found of that are in my own life.

22
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,310
The most amazing things I've been able to do with anything are when I've collaborated with other people

23
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,050
trying to do the same things I am and collaborated with people that have complimentary skills to mine.

24
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,560
If you bring your skills together and someone else's skills together in the discussion question then

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,010
this course then you can get some amazing results.

26
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,950
Some of the lecturers specifically also have discussions related to that lecture.

27
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,720
So if you have questions about that lecture for example or if you have questions about the second lecture

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,900
or another lecture and of course you can click on the discussion button here and then you can go over

29
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,110
to the right side up and the right hand corner and you can click on this button and you can see all

30
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,680
of the discussions that relate specifically to this lecture.

31
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,780
If you have problems with things like the course loading or problems with technical issues you can often

32
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,540
download the lecture to get around those problems.

33
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:54,150
If you have technical problems with working on you to me such as videos playing or payment issues or

34
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,330
anything else with you to me just go to support dot dot com and you can get answers there you can search

35
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,660
Eudemus specific questions like lecture's missing or lecture's not playing right.

36
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,650
And if you have problems you can actually contact you to me by opening a support ticket down here at

37
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,570
the bottom.

38
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:18,090
All Erman than I do is upload lecture's to this course and then manage the tools to make gifs any of

39
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,860
the tools not working properly.

40
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,250
Any technical problems only you and me can solve Erman and I cannot solve them.

41
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,610
So thank you very much for getting this far into the course are ready Armand and I are consistently

42
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:35,660
working to make this the best course possible for you and we'd love to know if you liked the course.

43
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,870
If you have any ideas for what we can add to it also.

44
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,390
Thank you.
