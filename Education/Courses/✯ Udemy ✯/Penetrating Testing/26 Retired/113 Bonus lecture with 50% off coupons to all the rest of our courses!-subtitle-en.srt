1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,180
Thank you very much for finishing this course.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:09,110
Awesome work getting all the way through it or skipping the bottom to find the bonus either way.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,580
Thank you for making it to the very last video on the course.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,510
This video is going to show you how to get every other course that Ermine's teaching for 50 percent

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:26,790
off and it will show you how to get free coupons to any course I'm teaching and it will recommend some

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,060
courses you might want to do next.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,300
So this is my website.

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,790
Jerry Banfield dot com slash courses.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,460
I'm grateful that I'm teaching with Erman because Erman just wants to teach.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,760
He doesn't want to fool around with having to do marketing spend thousand dollars advertising courses

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,500
and figure out a way to do it.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,640
My specialty is Internet marketing online advertising so Armon and I have teamed up.

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,320
All he does is make the courses and my primary role is to advertise them and sell them.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,390
That's why you're here with me now and explain the value of them to you.

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,160
So all the courses you can find Ermine's profile in the course you can always just search on you to

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,370
me for Erman Kalponik and click on Ermin chronic there.

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,530
Now you can see the courses Erman is currently teaching now some of these.

18
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,480
By the time you watch this there may be more.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,710
This is the first course we made together.

20
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,160
If you want to learn about Wireshark and tracking network traffic this may be really helpful for you.

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,680
That complete hacking course you're enrolled in this.

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:36,900
Now the Red Hat Linux and sent OS if you want to continue to enhance your Linux skills and maybe take

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,090
the Linux Red Hat certified system administrators Zahm this might be a great course to take.

24
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,160
Next for hacking if you want to have your own functional key logger.

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,320
This seems to be one of the favorite courses people take.

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,550
Next is it shows you exactly how to build an advanced key logger using C++.

27
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:02,850
It currently is undetectable by any anti-virus software and Ermine's shows you how to build it from

28
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,110
start to finish.

29
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,340
If you don't know C++ at all you might want to take this learn and understand C++ course first and then

30
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,520
take the advanced key logger course after that so that you'll be more comfortable in C++ to build the

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,880
key logger then.

32
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,390
This is a free course if you're in the hacking course.

33
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,040
This just has the first couple of hours for free so if you're already in the hacking course there's

34
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,780
no need to take this one.

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,740
If you want to master the Linux command line and adventure bash programming then this bash programming

36
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,980
course with Erman might be a good course to take.

37
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,800
Next you can see the prices I'm here and you can get 50 percent off all of these on my website so Ermine's

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,880
courses are currently right in the middle straight down so the hacking.

39
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,660
Wireshark.

40
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,960
BASH key logger understands C++.

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,350
Redhat straight down in the middle to get these all you do then you just click on the coupon and it

42
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,440
opens up a page with the coupon already applied.

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,900
So to do this I have to go private browser because I'm already browsing this now so this is what it

44
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,850
look like.

45
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,980
You can see it with the coupon already applied and then you just click on any other link.

46
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,410
For example if I go back here grab one to the wireshark course and then come back over and tap this

47
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:20,950
in.

48
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,520
Then you put that in.

49
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,260
You can see that it's 50 percent off that way.

50
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,520
So any of these links will get you 50 percent off to Ermine's courses.

51
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:37,350
Now I have 60 plus courses I'm new to me right now I'm teaching I'm jury BANFIELD So you go find my

52
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,160

You can see how many courses I'm teaching and you can get half off of any of those courses.

54

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,030
You can learn about Bitcoin.

63
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:26,540
I would think there's a great opportunity to use bitcoin in the world of ethical hacking especially

68
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,270
I've tried to pair up with instructors who are similar to me so you can see Ermine's teaching style

69
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,110
and my teaching style as a big overlap so then all the courses I'm teaching it tends to work the same

70
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,770
