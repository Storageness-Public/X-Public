1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,480
This Course offers you the chance to go from a beginner who's never used anything in this course all

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,260
the way to advanced I would say advanced as someone who is employable who can proficiently work with

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:20,080
all the tools in this course and who can earn a good salary in a job or working online.

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,990
In using what you see in these tools and can successfully use the things for themselves obviously watching

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,400
25 hours of video in this course is not going to take you to the advanced level by itself.

6
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:42,810
This course gives you a strong foundation upon which you can use the motivation from this course that

7
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:49,440
you've enjoyed learning with it to build on that foundation into advanced this course gives you enough

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,890
to become proficient.

9
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:59,100
I've noticed it takes me around 20 hours of using something of taking a course of interacting and going

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,720
hands on to get proficient.

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:08,040
That means you can feel reasonably comfortable using the tools you can feel reasonably comfortable doing

12
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,060
the things you see in this course.

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,250
That's the foundation on which you can build into advanced.

14
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,060
So this course will not take you into being an expert by itself.

15
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,900
You have to do the work along with this course and I've learned this I'm teaching 43 courses I'm new

16
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,790
to me now.

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,920
Almost all of which I've learned in the last four years and I've partnered up as you can see on this

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,700
course with Erman I've partnered up with people who are much better than I am at the subject that we're

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,950
teaching here.

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:48,690
The idea is that if you partner up with people who are better than you you learn rapidly all the subjects

21
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,390
that I've been able to learn quickly.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,670
I've learned from other people who were ahead of me.

23
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,470
So when you take this course you're learning from people who are ahead of where you're at.

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,620
And then when you connect with students and this course when you go in the discussions and you see the

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,200
other people learning with you the other people posting things in here with you and you take the time

26
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,000
you can click on their profile and view their profile and send them a message.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You can connect with other students in this course and learn together and collaborate and then you can

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,660
share the energy of collaborating together.

29
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,580
You can talk you can get to know people and that's how you can go to advanced going to advance takes

30
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,360
a lot of time and energy and effort and to get to advanced usually need to love what you're doing.

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,570
And any subject I've been advanced I've loved what I'm doing enough to do it a little bit every day.

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,760
The courses I'm teaching by myself that go to an advanced level in the course just like this one goes

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,040
to an advanced level here with me and Erman these courses are founded on thousands of hours of experience.

34
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:02,400
Erman has a ridiculous amount of time that he's put into learning and using the subjects he's teaching

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,310
here with you.

36
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,030
All you have to do is put the time and energy into learning and using these subjects yourself and you

37
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,700
will get to advanced.

38
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,420
To summarize I hope this course gives you motivation to see if you want to get too advanced.

39
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,980
And if you're willing to put the same amount of time and effort into learning ethical hacking that Ermin

40
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:30,240
has put into learning ethical hacking then you will get the same skills at the same level that Erman

41
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,350
is teaching the course.

42
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,380
And thank you very much for watching this.

43
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,900
And I hope this gives you a clear direction as to how you can use this course to go from beginner to

44
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,620
advanced.
