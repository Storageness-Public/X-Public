1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,830
What is it you're really here for.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,580
What do you hope to gain out of learning about hacking.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,310
Are you hoping that you can learn these skills and use them to help other people to make a decent life

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:20,550
for yourself of service where you can help other people to protect their systems from Black Hand hackers

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,430
and where people will pay you a fee or an hourly rate to help them out to look over their systems to

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,250
test their systems and to secure their systems.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,260
Are you looking to use this course to take more for yourself to take more money to take more reputation

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,550
to take down someone else who deserves to be taken down.

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,010
I've learned the hard way.

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,320
I've done both.

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,820
And right now I'm doing what I said first.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,670
I've made this course to serve you to be useful for you the information in itself is neutral.

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,270
It's not good or bad.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,200
How you use it determines whether it's good or bad.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:06,840
And I've used hacking in my life to take down people companies games that I thought deserved it.

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,830
I've used a lot of the skills in my life to try and take more for myself to get more money to get more

17
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,030
reputation to feel good about myself.

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,980
And as long as I use the skills in my life to take from others I was miserable.

19
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,580
I lived in fear of the day when all those others that I'd taken from would come back to judge me and

20
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,100
come back to ask for everything I'd taken.

21
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,370
And then I would have nothing left.

22
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:42,910
Today I live a life of service that has come out of the misery of misusing so many of the things I learned

23
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,450
and was given in life.

24
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:50,650
When you use things for everyone's good you can have a wonderful life of peace where you don't have

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,110
to be afraid of who's going to knock on your door.

26
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,660
You don't have to be afraid of what people are saying behind your back about what you're doing where

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:04,270
you don't have to be afraid of your friends using your computer and finding out what you're doing on.

28
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:11,050
I'm grateful today they live a life of transparency where everything I'm doing is out in the open where

29
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:17,260
everything I'm doing I'm ok sharing with you about I'm ok talking with anyone about who wants to talk

30
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:25,300
about it today and live a life free of shame where I can use the skills I learned in life for good to

31
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,400
help people.

32
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,010
The choice is up to you.

33
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,230
And I hope what you learn in this course you use to help other people.
