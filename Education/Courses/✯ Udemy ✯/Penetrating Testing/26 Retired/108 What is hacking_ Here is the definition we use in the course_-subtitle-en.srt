00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,040
What does the term hacking mean hacking can mean a lot of different things.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,610
Most generally it means to use something in a way it was not designed to be used.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:18,360
So when anything's designed it has an intended purpose and intended use in mind that's given by the

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:18,960
designer.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,350
So if I make something for you I have a certain way I think you're going to use it if you use it in

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,370
any way besides what I've done in terms of designing it for you to use it that way.

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,540
You could call that hacking for this course.

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:42,090
We're focusing mainly on computer security hacking which generally means someone who exploits weaknesses

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,080
in a computer system or a computer network.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,300
If you want a lot more information on this you can just go to the Wikipedia dot org article and look

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,840
up hacker and hacking on Wikipedia if you want me to read all of the text on this article which fully

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,760
explains so many things about hacking including history.

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,090
Then just post the discussion and let me know you'd like me to read the whole thing for you.

14
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,760
I trust that you can read if you want to learn more about the exact meaning of the terms and we'll give

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,730
you a strong foundation to go into using the rest of this course.

16
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:22,170
If not Erman will explain more about the specific terms that he thinks are most important for you to

17
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,150
learn going forward.

18
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,560
The bottom line of all of this is that hacking can include a lot of different things.

19
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,540
And what you're given in this course is a set of tools that can make hacking a lot easier.

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,430
This often is referred to in some of the people have taken the course of that it as a script kiddie

21
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:49,080
someone who just uses tools other people made to break into systems the way I look at things it's all

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,630
about results.

23
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,490
And if you're trying to learn a skill you need to be able to produce some results out of learning that

24
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:03,340
skill if you want to use the tools that make it easier to learn how to do things.

25
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,620
Then to me that's my approach.

26
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,690
Usually there's no need to learn things based on a principle when what you need is results.

27
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,430
I hope if you're using this course you can use this for good to help other people secure their systems

28
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,240
against black hat hackers who are using these exact same tools and skills to take things and steal.

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,260
Thank you very much for watching this.

30
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,450
And Irma We'll talk a lot more about the terms you see on this page.
