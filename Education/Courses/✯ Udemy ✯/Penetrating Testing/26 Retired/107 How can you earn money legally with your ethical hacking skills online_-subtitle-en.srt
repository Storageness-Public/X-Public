1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,510
The skills you learn in this course in ethical hacking and computer security are very valuable skills

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:16,290
that offer tons of ways to make money legally working online helping other people and companies to secure

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,320
their computers against exactly what you learn in this course.

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:28,320
Now I'm assuming you can figure out all kinds of legal ways to make money using the skills you learn

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,310
in this course and I'm trusting that you will aim your powers for good that you will use the skills

6
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,080
to do good things to help people and to serve other people online.

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,180
And if you don't that's up to you right here you've got ways you can legally use these skills to make

8
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,900
money to have job security and to consistently get paid without any fear of anything bad happening to

9
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,640
you.

10
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:02,580
I work that way today after doing things that did not work that way and where I was afraid of what would

11
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,970
happen of doing things that weren't legal that make money.

12
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,750
And I'm very lucky I'm here today and I can work peacefully.

13
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:17,310
So I'm showing you that right here the main way you can use these skills to quickly find an opportunity

14
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,930
to make some money out of them and to keep learning them is an up or down come up or Dotcom's formerly

15
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,110
oDesk and Elance.

16
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,820
It is the world the largest online freelancing platform.

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,850
That means you can put a profile up and you can use your profile then to get jobs that are exclusively

18
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,180
online that pay by the hour or by project.

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:45,070
And then you earn money by doing work for people in companies that need help with the skills you have.

20
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,400
Now this is the tip of the iceberg what I'm showing here.

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,450
I hope what this lecture communicated is that there's a giant potential to use these skills online to

22
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,620
make money in legitimate ways to enhance your career and your resume of what you can do your skills

23
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,470
for the world.

24
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:09,530
Now all I've done is enter ethical hacking into search term looking at freelancers who are already doing.

25
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,130
What I'm saying is possible for you to do.

26
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,990
And these other profiles I've put it down are at least an hour and build.

27
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,770
So these are people who actually got paid to do this.

28
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,440
No one who's trying or hoping these are people who actually got paid there's hundreds of them alive

29
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,530
right now on up work and you can be one of them using exactly what you learn in this course.

30
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,200

Thirty four hours here forty four an hour.

34

India twenty five an hour here 11 an hour in Macedonia five dollars an hour for this company $50 an

$40 an hour.

41
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:28,320
What I hope you can see out of this and Pakistan 123 hours of work here $15 an hour top rated.

42
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,780
What I hope you can see out of these profiles I've shown you is that people all over the world are using

43
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,300
the same skills you are learning here to work and make money online for clients that need help with

44
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,010
this.

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,930
Now work is just the number one Web site.

46
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,960
For this there's all kinds of other web sites you can find.

47
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,470
You can use Linked In.

48
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,980
You can use fiver or dot com you can find more niche specific sites.

49
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:58,920
The point is you know there are legal ways to make money helping people with the skills you're learning.

50
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,820
You know all you have to do is keep looking around.

51
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,810
Make an effort and you will find some of those opportunities yourself.

52
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,360
That's why I've shared this with you.

53
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,240
I hope it's useful in getting motivation to learn these skills and I appreciate your time you've spent

54
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,800
here.

55
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,730
I value your feedback on this course at any time.
