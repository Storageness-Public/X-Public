00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
Welcome all to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,600
Today we're going to actually start building out keylogger.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,170
I will make the basic and most primitive of keyloggers.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:18,200
It will have some inherit logical flaws, such as maxing out CPU

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,000
What I would like you to do is go into discussion section

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:35,600
and simply suggest what sort of abilities would you like me to give to this keylogger.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,000
For example, somebody would say "Well, I would like to hide it, you know"

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,200
and somebody else could say "Well, I would like it to be able to have an emailing function of a sort"

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,600
and another person could say "Well, I would like it to have an FTP function"

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,400
"I would like it to be configurable in this way or in that way"

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,610
and "I would like to use it for this purpose and for that purpose"

12
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,200
Make sure it's all legal when you ask me about it

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:11,780
because I will not assist anything that is against
regulation so I'm giving you the freedom

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:20,009
the choice to ask me I can't promise
that I will fulfill your wishes I will

15
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,970
try I will have a look if there are lots
of suggestions I hope that there will be

16
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,009
able pick a few and I'll see what I can
do but you don't have to worry about it

17
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,420
I will add more functionality is over
time as well

18
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:38,170
anyway let's go ahead and begin doing
this

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,090
begin to begin writing the codes of the
first to get real going to need are two

20
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,020
header files so windows . age and when
user . age because we want to be using

21
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:56,210
some functions we age for which that
those are the requirements anyway so

22
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:04,360
let's go ahead and type in char C we
will declare one character variable and

23
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,200
clear another one which will be C-one

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,209
a charge can have as I said before E

25
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:17,760
letter which it but we can actually
assigned a number as well so let this be

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:29,700
a and let this the 67 I believe this is
the ASCII table sure to in a moment

27
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:47,440
let's go ahead and write see out see and
and c1 let's see what we will get can

28
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,299
you guess it

29
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:54,220
oh yeah well though he can get so this
is a and we are signing a numerical

30
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:01,340
value to each character type variable if
you do this this will because this will

31
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,230
be taken from BS this this is actually a
numerical representation of a character

32
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:13,609
from the ASCII table and 67 corresponds
to dealer tate's let her eight so

33
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:18,239
assigning a like this and assigning 67

34
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:26,290
this is pretty much the same thing let's
go ahead and see

35
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:35,769
go lol total missed their by the way
it's not sixty seven but you can see

36
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:41,639
that it's thought 67 here either it's a
capitalist who see so you are not

37
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,329
expected to know the ASCII table by
heart here I have one in the net hundred

38
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:51,260
of them feel free to look for it we just
go

39
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,980
step back I just taken one hundred and
ninety ASCII table what had denied

40
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,200
because I want to get an extended one
but you don't need to open one hundred

41
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:10,319
and ninety go ahead and click on it what
was referring to an able to 180 I wanted

42
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,879
to have one hundred and ninety members
that 180 characters minimum so I was

43
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:19,410
hoping it would help the out there
anyway

44
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:29,120
lower case is a 97 and 67 as you can see
is the capital of Terry see interesting

45
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,740
right kept illiteracy is 67 that's where
I listed and lower case is 97 so it's

46
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,919
gonna change it

47
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:46,210
87% wait for it and there you go

48
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:53,610
a no big deal not a bigger air it's all
fine and dandy and it all works out says

49
00:04:53,610 --> 00:05:02,150
he can see 2012 4567 so on 255 you have
each character has a numerical

50
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:07,340
representation the first call you see
the one that at selecting downward says

51
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,840
characters down below its 200 know and
dead characters the third coat the Turk

52
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,560
Cullen is a description which has no
character start heading to start of

53
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,900
texts except as a descriptive values
does not value the descriptions and on

54
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:32,419
the left side those are valleys so let's
go ahead and you can find the

55
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:37,349
presentations fuski tables around the
net so no worries there they will read

56
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:44,159
to look at as much as you want you don't
need anything extra there that's public

57
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:51,159
domain basically anyway let's go ahead
and delete this declaration that these

58
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:55,729
signed a lease because we don't need
them or 1 p.m. at the moment and we

59
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,689
don't need to see out

60
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:02,999
statement idea what we need to do now is
create an infinite loop and we could

61
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:06,919
have created it because we want to
keylogger to be running continuously so

62
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:13,749
we don't want it to stop until the user
actually stops it so let's go ahead and

63
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:21,139
let's go ahead and do that I will tape
in while this is what we are doing yet

64
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:25,399
this is a mother a similar way of doing
it but if you want to create an infinite

65
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:32,589
loop would've for it open for open
semicolon semicolon dentists will create

66
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:39,539
an infinite loop with 40 just something
I just a new piece of information that I

67
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:45,369
wanted to give you also we will need a
loop within a loop so we will need

68
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:50,369
nested loops here will need to use them
in order to accomplish our goal our

69
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:54,499
second loop will be defining the
character the range of characters that

70
00:06:54,499 --> 00:07:03,139
we are interested in why you say well
are you interested in this to you at two

71
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:08,979
hundred and nineteen is this interesting
to you in any way or this pipe looking

72
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:17,179
like thing at 205 or this health thing
or reverse te at 193 or something like

73
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:17,909
that

74
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:22,659
those characters I don't know I guess
you can include them but I don't think

75
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:31,550
it's a good idea that or I sometimes to
think I include once 222 but I think

76
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:38,349
that 190 should be optimal even though
you're gonna still includes characters

77
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:45,379
that you're never gonna get but doesn't
really matter anyway let's go let's go

78
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:52,129
and open up clips back let's go back
there so how do we stop before we

79
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,860
actually specified the range with me to
show what a nested loop is Sophie taken

80
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,449
here in equals

81
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:25,789
0 is less than three plus and here yet
another loop so for in 20 GA is a less

82
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:35,310
then just three who cares for us and for
the sake of orientation group with the

83
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:50,829
curly brackets ears and CEO second and
then I want you value of J

84
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:57,510
to be printed out as well and then I
would like a new line thank you and I

85
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,750
will go outside of the second group and
will go into the first and will take his

86
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:23,889
see out first and here we would like the
value of I go it'll be a deal there

87
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:31,870
anyway the logic of this is following
this for loop will begin once it begins

88
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,579
it will start to evaluating the
conditions laid out within it if it

89
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:42,670
violates the true so if it is indeed
less than three it will start the

90
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:49,560
execution of whatever code is within
within the curly brackets off the for

91
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:58,420
loop and here we have another full loop
which is nested here what that means is

92
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:04,839
that now the program will simply start
shooting this loop and it will not it

93
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,730
will continue to execute it until it
finishes it so what happens here is that

94
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,490
this for lou

95
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:17,000
sorry evaluating this condition here and
for as long as this condition here is

96
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,290
true it's gonna keep on printing this
when it becomes false ben je mange

97
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:29,880
becomes greater or equal to 3 will start
exit the second loop and enter the first

98
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,260
loop again that it will print our
central print this out first and go back

99
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,550
to evaluating this condition is this
condition turns out to be true again

100
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,670
then this loop will start over and so on
three times so basically this loop

101
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,630
starts over as everything has resided
here Jays again

102
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:57,300
0 so it will repeat three times again
just secretly how that works out to

103
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:07,680
sprinting sewed onto the screen no big
deal there I am second 0 I am second one

104
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,970
I am sickened too because the situation
goes 01223 times and then it exists as I

105
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:22,240
said here in it says I first heard it's
zero here so this is the first iteration

106
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,240
you can see it's that it starts the
second loop again and it starts to say I

107
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,420
am second 0 I am sick and one second to
see how the numbers reset and then it

108
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:42,190
goes I am first one because this is the
second pass and the second pass again we

109
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:48,310
have the same situation I am second 05
second one and 2nd do and so on and so

110
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:54,839
forth until the end hopefully this this
is clear if not well you have the

111
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:08,980
discussions I am gladly answered queries
their semi colons and now we need to go

112
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:15,680
ahead and basically specified the range
of the character is that we would like

113
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,430
to

114
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:23,860
get four and let's use the character
which we have declared up above the

115
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:31,460
beginning just go ahead and use it and
say that it will be equal to eight so

116
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:38,050
those are that that's the beginning of
our range and the very end of our range

117
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:45,360
can be out two hundred and twenty to say
let's be a little bit greedy though is

118
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,209
there really a point for it at all

119
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:57,370
yes actually there is there is a point
so sequels 28 C is less or equal to 22

120
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:09,640
to my colon and C plus it's open curly
brackets now we know we actually do need

121
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,700
curly brackets

122
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:16,820
there for statics or orientation or
anything of a kind and you see what a

123
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,430
key is pressed there is a system
interrupt system interrupt is is it you

124
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:30,580
can represent the number so it's 32767
looks like we need to create a

125
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:37,170
conditional if statement to know when
somebody presses a key on the keyboard

126
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:43,029
and if somebody presses a key on the
keyboard please do something with it so

127
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:57,540
ok let's create a tad condition we need
a function get get the surprise the

128
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,380
tickets until the outrageous functions
but ok sometimes there a little bit of

129
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:08,630
course bailout get key state Salesi

130
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:22,110
and after the sea compare it 2-3 2767

131
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:30,160
and if that is true we are going to do
something with it anyway

132
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,540
over here we have the range that we are
checking so disparate groups conducting

133
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:45,850
checks and this one is figuring out if
the key if there was an interrupt so if

134
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:53,690
there is an interrupt for a particular
key then that key then we will do

135
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:59,310
something with it what shall we do with
it I don't know what save it to a file

136
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,740
actually that could be that could be
interesting so once again this is the

137
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:11,610
interim so if there is an interrupt the
character will be store that with the

138
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:18,130
character will be stored and we will be
able to do something with it so let's go

139
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:32,230
ahead and type in stream right but this
and let's just go ahead and created in

140
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:40,200
our workspace directory so no need to go
anywhere else was

141
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:49,350
in court txt and there is one more thing
disappear into a taping and I S colon

142
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:56,140
colon what we are specifying what we're
dealing with this is that we don't want

143
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,510
her file to be re-written every single
time somebody presses a key because if

144
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:05,800
we didn't specify this last part here it
would quite literally mean that once it

145
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,250
gets recorded and the next time somebody
presses a key the file will be reopened

146
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:17,670
again and at that point of time whatever
is contained within that file will get

147
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:23,650
overwritten with new content every every
previous he would get overwritten by a

148
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:31,010
new key which would be pretty stupid so
let's just do it doesn't Appian right

149
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:38,620
now we're gonna whatever gonna break
right character see that's it

150
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,520
place a semicolon at the end and that is
all we need to do in order to start

151
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,820
recording characters before implementing
any sort of putting in any sort of a

152
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,430
filtration system in which we will
absolutely need to do

153
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:09,430
press Ctrl F 11 to run this list where
is the error ok so we have not included

154
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:15,860
the necessary header files for this to
be possible what have we learned before

155
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:27,640
include stream very simple forgot to
include Adobe deal happens all the time

156
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:35,780
go through it through it to exit so the
program is running but you can't really

157
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:42,550
see this does running anywhere can you
can you if you rented from the council

158
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:46,169
you probably could like this

159
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:52,580
this is the console and Eclipse you can
it doesn't really matter because it is

160
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:58,749
better display anyway we don't want to
be able to see anything however I assure

161
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:03,509
you this is functional so let's go ahead
and type in Skype something into our

162
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:09,809
opened up a CMD you can open up whatever
you want your browser if you want

163
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:16,749
actually that might be a good idea

164
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:28,460
yahoo.com and I still haven't removed
this fasting thing ok and what's a sign

165
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,710
in

166
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:42,830
they've been the username user password
will be worried I don't even need to

167
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:49,019
click Sign in or anything of a card we
can just go ahead and open up our

168
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:59,840
project so once again you were project
files by default are located in C users

169
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,269
and then choose the user name of the
current user here but his creator and

170
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,850
then go to work space and select your
project here which mine is key logger

171
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,869
and select the file hirsute says he
record txt that's how we have names are

172
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:20,779
file and there you go I have taped in
Yahoo and didn't record it thought so we

173
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:27,509
need to fix that I don't know what the
space here is probably a tad it is a tab

174
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:31,909
so we need to have filtered out through
and make it better so you see if they

175
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:41,359
put in username and password i mean this
is a tuzla through the different example

176
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:52,100
let's use let's use Sean though that'll
be my username and password

177
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,779
probably a little bit confusing when I
type in the username and password with

178
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,759
when I feel username password with you

179
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:07,609
and password at system of record and
their ago you have john doe there are

180
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:11,749
some additional characters here but we
need to create a filtration system for

181
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:14,209
this anyway all farewell
