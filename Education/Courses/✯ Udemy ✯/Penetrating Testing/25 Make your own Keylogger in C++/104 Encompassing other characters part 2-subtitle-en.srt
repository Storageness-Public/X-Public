1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome all to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,109
Today we're gonna go ahead and do some character filtering.

3
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:07,900
You might have noticed that I have changed the code

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,700
to a pretty good extent first of

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,800
First off, are the break statements

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,000
that I have inserted pretty much everywhere

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,700
at the end of each check.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,000
So if the check succeeds, don't go any further.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Also, that's done

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Excellent

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,800
So in the "else" part, we have this switch statement

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,500
and for all these characters, you see parentheses because

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,400
because how do you type in parentheses?

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,600
Well, you open up your text editor.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:53,000
On my keyboard it's Shift 0, and that's a parentheses

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's open up parentheses -- That's Shift 9

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and to close the parentheses, that would be Shift 0

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,800
What did I do here then?

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,000
This is the ASCII code for 048

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You can see that here

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There we go

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,189
So 48 is the ASCII code for 0

23
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:25,000
simple as that

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,950
and I have placed it here

25
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,000
So when I press e0

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,579
depending on where the Shift is pressed or not

27
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:39,000
I will either record a parenthesis or I will record a 0

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,200
So this function, I will verify

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,800
I will check whether the Shift is being pressed or not.

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,000
So if it's being pressed

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,200
and 0 is being pressed along with it

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,310
then this will happen

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,100
If it's not, then I will just write 0 and that's it.

34
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,300
No big deal

35
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,600
Now if this invalidates the true

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,110
I don't want you to go checking any other cases out.

37
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,740
I don't care, I have answers to the break statement

38
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,750
so exit the loop immediately.

39
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,560
Next up -- 49, which was for 1

40
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,600
Now notice instead of a 0, I could have
also placed either...

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, let me put it this way

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,780
I could have placed "key"

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,920
and that would have the same functionality

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,600
but instead, I would like to place a 0

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,800
primarily because I can orientate myself easier

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,330
within confines of my own code

47
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,390
Why? Well you know, when you're reading through it

48
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,700
if you have just the right key, right key, right key, right key

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
you don't really know you have this

50
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,000
and then right key below

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,500
you don't know what is this key below going to be.

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,000
Like this -- You do

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So that's how I make them from basically 0 to 9

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,880
So you have 0, and then you have 1

55
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,200
So notice that this is the keyboard layout that I am using

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,500
but even if you have a wrong keyboard layout

57
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,800
and if it's recording wrong things

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,380
but in the sets.

59
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,500
So on number 1, how many options you think you have?

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, let's see

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,459
I can press 1 and then I can press Shift and 1

62
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,100
and that gives me an exclamation mark.

63
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,590
1 is going to be the same for every keyword.

64
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,100
Shift 1 will perhaps be different for some other keyboards

65
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,200
but there are only a couple possible combinations

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,300
well, a couple combinations that are most likely to be used

67
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,489
maybe like two or three

68
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,400
and that's it.

69
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,200
So you still have a good amount to the password.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I mean, you have the large segment of the password

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,000
that you can pretty much guess it out of one or two tries basically.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
Anyway, let's go ahead and delete this.

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's keep on moving forward.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,700
I have inserted that for every one of these.

75
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,500
So you see this is a backslash, a 2, and I have this pound

76
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,400
that's on 3 dollars on 4

77
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,299
I do believe that 7 is a slash.

78
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:25,500
So let's see -- 6 is a caret, 5 is a percent sign

79
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,160
7 is not a percent sign...Let's check that out.

80
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,000
Indeed it is

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,200
Okay, so on my keyword it is

82
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,500
and then we go down further

83
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,700
asterisk and the open parenthesis on 9

84
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,900
and so on and so forth.

85
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,200
So I have inserted a good amount of these.

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,800
Make sure that you insert them in accordance...

87
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,100
You can either copy mine

88
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,400
or you can insert them in accordance with your own keyboard` layout

89
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,600
but basically what we're doing here is checking whether the Shift is pressed

90
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
If shift is not pressed

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
go ahead and just write the number corresponding to the ASCII

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,600
or write a character corresponding to the ASCII

93
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,280
but if shift is pressed in combination with this

94
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,800
then write something else, whatever the result of that might be.

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,000
For me, it's a right parentheses, so to say

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and for you, it might be something else

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,760
but hey, feel free to follow it through and see what you get.

98
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,210
If not, I mean literally, just go on to your keyboard

99
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,890
take it in your hands

100
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,900
take a look at it, press Shift, press 1

101
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,410
and see which character you get

102
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,500
and then, put it in here.

103
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:46,500
That's all you need to do in order to get the characters from 0 to 9

104
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Very easy

105
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,230
No big deal

106
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,000
They will get recorded and it will get printed out.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,720
So, now that we have all of them

108
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,500
let's go ahead and verify that this is indeed correct.

109
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,000
How do we do that?

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Just go ahead and compile it

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,729
and wait for it

112
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:10,700
Excellent

113
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,000
So it is up and running.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,279
Okay, I have a lot of these things that I've tested out here

115
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,500
to make sure that the keys do work.

116
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,400
We will be adding more of these in the follow-up tutorial.

117
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,200
If you wish skip that, feel free.

118
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,789
If you want to add your custom keys that you wish to add

119
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,300
go ahead and do it

120
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,000
that correspond to some keyboards that you might want

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
but these ones generally will fit a lot of keyboards.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I myself am using a UK keyboard

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,400
but a lot of keys are very similar for the US keyboard as well.

124
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,300
So just take a look at your keyboard layout and then change it

125
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,500
or change it to your target environment's keyboard sets.

126
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,789
If you're uncertain, you can go for the US keyboard.

127
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:59,000
A lot of people...Most people tend to use that one.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, I don't know

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
in the Americas and Europe, people tend to use it

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,529
but I don't know elsewhere in the world.

131
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:08,370
Not sure what is the preferred layout.

132
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,500
Anyway, so let's go ahead and start typing.

133
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,800
So let's first verify that we have all the numbers in place

134
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,500
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0

135
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,000
and let's go ahead and open it.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,900
This could from the previous ones, or I could have pressed it.

137
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,839
I probably didn't press it,  but to be on the safe side

138
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,500
to know for sure that it works, let's go ahead and delete it

139
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,080
save the file while it's running, and repeat the process

140
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,900
Okay, so it is recording numbers without any problems.

142
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:59,000
Now let's us go ahead and see if it's recording the symbols

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
and there you go.

144
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,800
We are also recording the symbols.

145
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,039
So I can put it here, like one underneath the other

146
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,000
so it's easier to match them up.

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,800
So if somebody is using, you know, these things

148
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,000
and their passwords or something of a kind

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,500
then you are able to easily track them

150
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,250
but you know, usually they won't.

151
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:27,000
80% to 90% of time, people just use upper and lower case letters for this purpose

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and the upper and lower case letters, of course, still work.

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
abc and ABC

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,300
We will add a few other functionalities

155
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,469
and a few other filters for the keys

156
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:47,200
but hey, you know if you have some filters that you would like to implement

157
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,100
or that you have implemented for the keys

158
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,810
feel free to post them in the discussions.

159
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,200
I'll be happy to take a look at them

160
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,600
and perhaps we can implement them in the whole project

161
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,000
if we so choose.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,600
So you can see, I have numbers from 0 to 9

163
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
I have these characters

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,600
and I have upper and lower case letters.

165
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,800
So this the composition of about 90% of passwords out there in the world.

166
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,930
So we of course, need some other characters here as well.

167
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,400
Once we have them, that's gonna pretty much gonna be...

168
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:25,000
any possible combination that somebody might type into their keyboard

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
our keylogger will be able to record it and put it into a file

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,200
and then later on, hopefully, send it.

171
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,160
So once again, if you feel kinda bored

172
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,209
listening to me just putting in key filters

173
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:39,900
because that's completely up to you

174
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,000
what sort of key filters would you like to put in

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,320
you can feel free to skip that part

176
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,390
and go into the part where we will make our key logger

177
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,550
just do a few examples for the functionalities that I had in mind

178
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,040
take snapshots and to use the cameras

179
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,600
to use onboard camera or to just send an email

180
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,000
or something of a kind.

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,839
Anyway, that would be it for this tutorial.

182
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,200
Please make sure that you have these filters set up and running.

183
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,200
That you have uppercase and lowercase letters set up and running

184
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,400
because we are going to need all of this for the follow-up tutorials.

185
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,330
Until then, I bid you all farewell.
