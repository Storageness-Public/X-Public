1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome all to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,700
Today we will go ahead and set up the needed environment in order to be able to code in C++

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,400
and in the final account of things, make a keylogger.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,900
So while I was doing the testing, I had encountered into a lot of problems

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,200
and I have managed to solve them.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,000
If anybody's wondering, I am not a magician.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,100
I don't just go encounter problems and then just the type a few things and solve them immediately.

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,000
I do what everybody else does.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I go ahead and browse the web and try to figure things out where the problem lies.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,300
That is exactly what I did here

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:50,000
and I will show you what you need to do and where the problems will occur.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Anyway, so the first thing you will need is a IDE

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,700
so an integrated development environment

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:06,000
and for that I have chosen to install Eclipse, which is fantastic.

15
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,580
However its java-based and if a
java-based we will need something from

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:20,820
drama but will get that's really gotten
tape in the lips pressed enter it says

17
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,960
mars eclipse oK so that's just the
latest version you have

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,880
lunar eclipse marks mars eclipse I like
the Cal per click that I used for those

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:41,310
are just the danes for the versions just
like you have war for example Linux

20
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,549
distributions they can hold various
names I can't think of any at the moment

21
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,710
but for example you have Debian Weezy or
did you just see something of a kind for

22
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,549
experimental things and so on and so
anyway you get the idea the area that's

23
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:03,520
completely irrelevant mars eclipses just
a name for it thats mars released that

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,619
just the name for it again that's all
there is to it so anyway what would you

25
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:08,729
like to do

26
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,030
well we would like to download it so go
ahead and click on Download it's

27
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,159
completely free or you don't need to pay
for anything and let scrolled downward

28
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:24,159
it says eclipse IDE for Java developers
plugin in Eclipse for PHP this is the

29
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:31,360
one that we're looking for a solar
eclipse IDE for C C++ developers you

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,680
have an option here for Windows of
course you can change your target

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,239
environment here but we are downloading
the one for Windows you can also use it

32
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:47,010
to Linux it's also on Linux cell accused
UT creator for C++ in particular for

33
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,540
pretty much everything else eclipse is
also so let's go ahead and select here I

34
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,879
have a 64 bit system running I don't
know which sort of a system do you have

35
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:04,010
a 64 bit go ahead and download 32 bit
that's pretty much all you need to do

36
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:12,709
just check something really fast

37
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:16,680
need

38
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:24,790
their ago so you can just go ahead and
click on this PC or on my computer if

39
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,739
its return my computer discarding click
on Properties and you will be given this

40
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:35,700
problem here or you can check with your
system is 64 bit or 32 bit it says here

41
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,209
system type 64 bit operating 6 64 bit
operating system

42
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:49,269
ok so let's go ahead and close this
because we are not going to needed I'll

43
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,450
just minimize life file browser dare and
let's go ahead and downloaded so for

44
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:01,370
Windows 64 bit just go ahead and click
on it you will be redirected here it

45
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,409
says here download from Italy apparently
that's the closest to my current

46
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:13,930
location but you can go ahead and do dis
the link in new tab that's going to

47
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,620
prompt me to download it or I wanted to
begin your mirror am so sorry I just

48
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:27,120
clicked on it wrong choice it says or
pick a local mirror site below so done

49
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,720
with the leaders the cliffs and see how
easily erupt can deploy get it faster

50
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,190
here anyway so you have some things here
which are completely irrelevant for you

51
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:44,169
but down here it says choose a mirror
close to you take a look at these

52
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:48,380
countries here since says no you have a
lot of them

53
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:57,250
United Kingdom Germany Sweden whatever
and then you have North America here for

54
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:57,580
it

55
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,650
think of where you are in the world in a
physical sense and figure out which of

56
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,740
these locations is geographically
closest to you in order to increase the

57
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,550
speed of your download for me it says
okay this is this is your choice but you

58
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,820
can change it down below but i just i
just basically clicking on it no big

59
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,260
deal like this

60
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:24,450
and you will be prompted to download
Eclipse immediately go back to choose a

61
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,130
mirror and just gonna go ahead and
downloaded from the link that for

62
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,250
suggested to me just go ahead and click
on it that's all you need to do make

63
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:38,550
sure to select Save File and not open
file so save it may take a bit of time

64
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,910
for a deal I already have that would
have done that so the company canceled

65
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,290
this or something like that

66
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,920
not sure you might be prompted to
actually give some donations or

67
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,130
something of a kind

68
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:58,600
site but it doesn't feel it's not
mandatory or anything of a client you

69
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,590
can donate if you like if not its fine
you get all the features with you donate

70
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,340
or not completely irrelevant in terms of
functionality just go ahead and check if

71
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,210
I have it from my previous downloads
while it was running some tests he said

72
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:20,960
don't need to do I have it yes I do
excellent so I already have it

73
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,900
downloaded I don't need to do it again
so let's save some time just gonna go

74
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:33,040
ahead and close this the download file
which took from the net will be in your

75
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,430
downloads folder by default unless
you've actually changed it so just

76
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,120
here's how you would access it just go
ahead and click on downloads and then

77
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,740
find it here there you go

78
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,280
eclipse down below now I noticed that
the file is zipped so you need to open

79
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,510
up to you to unpack the files first
there are various tools to do this I'm

80
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,110
just go ahead and show you

81
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:07,969
virus running here so seven zip

82
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:12,659
that search engine that is the virus
that infects Firefox on Windows seven

83
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:17,899
messing around in open exposing the
machines as this is my test machine and

84
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:22,089
there is literally nothing of importance
here but I can't do without that they

85
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:26,360
don't have elsewhere anyway so go ahead
and click on Settings it this is also a

86
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,679
free software for you to unpack if you
don't already have one most likely have

87
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:35,509
something like wind which is a paid
version where you have seen as a poor

88
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:41,249
you have something else that's
completely irrelevant so you have the

89
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:50,579
exact file here the inner thigh or down
below you have the beta for windows I

90
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,679
really wouldn't recommend downloading
beaten just go ahead and say download on

91
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,649
. exam and that's it

92
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:02,889
download size is one megabyte she's
nothing just go ahead and run 26 file

93
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:11,019
software and their ago this is the
installation procedure going through its

94
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:18,099
going through thank you finish so you
don't need to follow this step if you

95
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:23,300
already have a software which you can
use to unzip a package if you don't have

96
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,729
to if you don't have a thought returns
at the package feel free to follow this

97
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,769
through or feel free to use any other
software to unzip that's completely up

98
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:31,269
to you

99
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:41,789
ok so let's go ahead and minimize this
and go ahead and open up 77 should pop

100
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,490
up

101
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:48,629
file manager takes me straight away to
down those which is very nice to have it

102
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:52,750
configured from before but if it doesn't
just change the path that whatever you

103
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:59,600
like or just save file open and then I
didn't find it doesn't really matter

104
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,660
just a pin the path where this file is
literally all you need to do

105
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,519
ok so but just double you don't even
need to type it in but just double

106
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,050
clicking on it you can actually browse
the file system and find whatever it is

107
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,920
that you're looking for anyway so let's
find a glimpse here and ok so let's just

108
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:31,350
expand this exon so we have eclipsed CPP
mars win32 x86 64 zip that is exactly

109
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,730
what I want to go ahead and click on
extract it says that its want to extract

110
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,720
into downloads again basically I'm gonna
go ahead and change that because I don't

111
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,709
want to do extracted downloads folder
head and I already have some

112
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,189
configuration files from before when I
was testing it out but I would like to

113
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:56,600
extracted to stop you can extract it
anywhere like create a shortcut on

114
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,839
desktop whatever you wish but for
testing purposes here I will go ahead

115
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:10,379
and its extracted so click on OK and ok
again

116
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:15,750
extraction process will be in drug
shouldn't take too long again this is

117
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,470
extracted anywhere you like to program
to program files or something of a calm

118
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,180
but I'm just gonna go ahead extracted to
desktop since it doesn't really matter

119
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:35,300
I'm just using this for educational
purposes anyway it's not like this is my

120
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:42,459
main machine tend to be a bit disorderly
they're probably something you can do

121
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:48,420
probably something that you can do
without so let's just let it run for a

122
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,810
little while not exactly the smallest of
packages

123
00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:01,160
opinions of packaging this is not a
fascist of machines because the virtual

124
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,570
machine again so please take that into
consideration I have a signed a second

125
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,350
CPU core to it

126
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,220
expedite process you do not need to
deliver just finally single CPU core

127
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:18,010
that's done you can close the sentence
if you have eclipsed here and now we're

128
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:31,540
gonna get an error you have eclipsed
except just put it on the stock closed

129
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:38,330
this animal so going to benefit the
taskbar anyway so go ahead and double

130
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,940
click on it and you'll get an error that
says Java Runtime Environment or Java

131
00:11:42,940 --> 00:12:00,710
Development Kit must be available no
problems let's go over to the net yet so

132
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,370
Java SE development kit 7 downloads

133
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:19,660
so where is it those clothes that are so
windows 64 so this is a Windows x64 and

134
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,260
we're just have a look at it

135
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:31,980
know this kid no not needed ok this is
the first the first version is the 32

136
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:41,080
bit the second version is 64 bit I'm not
mistaken I could be don't don't hate me

137
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:48,529
for it if I am just choose the I'm gonna
go ahead and choose the later one so the

138
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:53,839
last 12 Road go ahead and click on it so
you must accept the license agreement

139
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,080
for downloading I accept unknown license
agreement which no one in this world

140
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,190
treats and god knows what works what we
are

141
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,000
anyway you have chosen to open it

142
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:17,520
ok so save file its reporting it
requires four minutes for download that

143
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,120
differently consumes a little bit of
time but fortunately disease necessary

144
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,959
amount of time required for the download
to proceed

145
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,670
later on in Eclipse even though we will
need to even do we have everything

146
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,250
installed we have eclipsed the salt we
have Java SE development get to the

147
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:43,000
background we still need the compiler
something that will basically make

148
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,529
whatever is right whatever code rewrite
understandable to a machine to machine

149
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:55,190
can stand would rewrite and for Windows
you have a ton to do you have these

150
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:01,280
you have multiple compilers for it you
have one from Microsoft up to go ahead

151
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,510
and use an open source one which is
basically which was basically ported

152
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,500
over from Linux it's cold

153
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:23,600
doubly minimalist GNU for Windows ok so
you're here on their website so that

154

seconds for it happen W get excellence

do not change you can change it but a
cause you a world of hurt later on like

ahead and click on Continue now because

164
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,420
I've already done some installations and
this can happen even if you didn't do

165
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,380
any installations just asking me whether
I would like to run it now

reinstall if this doesn't happen to you

168
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,180
ok just text or whatever pops no big
deal

169
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,750
the installation process is underway so
this is the installation process

170
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:51,310
ways of savings already have it
installed installing gay so doing this

171
00:15:51,310 --> 00:16:02,680
the browser and we are done so click on
Continue something happening over there

172
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,850
ok so we are now in mean min Zhu W
Installation Manager and virtually all

173
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:16,450
of these are green but they won't be
able to be for you so all you need to do

174
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:23,540
is right click on this and then go mark
for installation click on that it will

175
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,970
become green next one mark for
installation click all of them in that

176
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,230
fashion so once again on D it's not
going to be green for you so just go

177
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,630
ahead and right click on it

178
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:44,760
click on mark for installation and then
it's going to go ahead and install the

179
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,630
packages so all of them you need to
select all of them go ahead and click on

180
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:54,230
installation in the upper left corner it
once you have selected all of them

181
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,170
Indy basic setup you have all packages
here but you don't really care about

182
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:06,240
that at the moment would you care about
is basic setup click on installation say

183
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,439
Update Catalog

184
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:19,530
exxon so update is complete please close
the dialog to continue

185
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:35,650
that's it

186
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:41,460
so it might take a bit longer for you if
you get prompted with anything just say

187
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:47,940
okay next whatever doesn't really matter
that much anyway it's just gonna go

188
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,260
through and caused these things are not
installed in your system they're gonna

189
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,850
it's gonna take awhile you know to pool
the information necessary for all of

190
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:02,940
this and install it if you encounter any
problems with this step just a few

191
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,290
screenshots let me know what you did and
we got stuck I will be more than happy

192
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,950
to help you out pretty simple just like
on installation Update Catalog once

193
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:19,340
again it's gonna run through and that's
it might get prompted with another

194
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,380
window if it's the first time insulation

195
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,010
no big deal just click Apply and next
that's all you need to do no big deal

196
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:32,320
there and it will take a bit longer time
you might wanna go and make a cup of

197
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,740
coffee while it finishes but to save
time I already have the package is

198
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,610
installed and just repeating the process
within still pictures anyway just go

199
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:48,460
ahead and close this because we no
longer need that lets see how do we

200
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,040
stand

201
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:58,100
clips download with the with the Java
Runtime Environment ok so this is my

202
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:07,720
troubleshooting browser no problems
there still were to respond okay so judy

203
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,530
is here has been downloaded just go
ahead and click on it again should be

204
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,460
fine

205
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:22,580
feel their part should pop up any moment
there we go so yes pairing to install

206
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:32,399
ok should next next

207
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:38,049
that's all we need to do just click on
Next thats windows for you probably why

208
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:41,760
so many people use it was just keep on
clicking Next for pretty much everything

209
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,390
sometimes you can listing stuff like
that but most of the time just tends to

210
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,490
work out although I do find it
frustrating as it doesn't give me as

211
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,480
much control as I would like

212
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,760
anyway I am running a little bit short
on time here so I will pause at Royal

213
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,080
here
