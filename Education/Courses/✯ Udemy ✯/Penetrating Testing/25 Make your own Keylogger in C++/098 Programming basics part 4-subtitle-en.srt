00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Welcome everybody to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,000
Today we're gonna go ahead and do a quite an important lecture on functions.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,300
So functions is something that we are going to need for the creation of our keylogger

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,000
and you will soon see what they are.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Basically, you create a function to group code

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,279
and let's say we create another function outside of our main function, in which everything gets code

7
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,800
and everything works through from the main function

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,000
but we can also create functions outside of main, and then code them within the main function.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,200
Why will we need this?

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,290
Well as I said, we need to group certain parts of the code

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,000
and create different functionalities for our program

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,500
that we are going to incorporate later on in process of the creation of the keylogger.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,800
Now here's a simple example --

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,699
Suppose you need a function to add two numbers

15
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:08,110
Do you want to really write a plus be every
time I mean ok he's a really simple

16
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,930
example but suppose you need the you
needed addition subtraction division and

17
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,560
multiplication so those could be four
functions and they could get called

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,360
whenever you would need to divide or
numbers or something like that

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,759
functions can do extremely complex
things they can do pretty much any thing

20
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,759
you can imagine and you can separate
your code with them and reuse it

21
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,180
basically so if you have a function that
is intended for one purpose you might be

22
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,189
in need of that purpose at a certain any
later point of time during the creation

23
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:51,270
of programs you can just reused that
particular function let me shoot us in a

24
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:58,219
practical example and it will be a lot a
lot clearer so up here above the main we

25
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:03,460
will declare our functions and down here
we will find them so to see when we will

26
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,079
write the proper code for them

27
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,340
functions have a return type so for me
it is an integer

28
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:20,269
a utopian turn 0 the statement read at
this instruction return 0 it terminates

29
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:28,530
the program but 00 is a integer and you
see here in front of the function will

30
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:37,069
you always have to specify the return
type so what are the main reasons by the

31
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,870
way that I thought perhaps using
strictly technical terms that he

32
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:52,370
full-time programmer or use as because I
barely learned in terms of C++ in terms

33
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,480
of other programming languages the only
two things that I needed for my purpose

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:05,110
which is pretty much a part and that is
what I'm trying to impress upon you as

35
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,400
well

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,910
fewer ads not a way to make games or
something like that is purely a way to

37
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:21,190
create pretty much malicious code which
we are not going to abused but we are

38
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,930
going to use for benevolent purpose in
any case it will be an illegal purpose

39
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:33,260
so yeah just throw that in somewhere

40
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,160
anyway let's go ahead and start breaking
our first function this function will

41
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,220
return integer as well or even better
let's go ahead and make this function

42
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:54,010
returns a double double and you can't AP
in sales call this function and

43
00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:05,560
dysfunction to double values double A
and then chroma double B functions do

44
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,239
not necessarily need argument need to
receive these values so I will show you

45
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,560
in a moment how you get past these
values to function so it can also be

46
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,820
like this this part can be empty no big
deal

47
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:26,020
it all depends what it is meant to do so
we have declared a function here and we

48
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:33,160
have put least a semicolon here but down
below we will open up curly brackets and

49
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:44,360
we will start writing or function or we
need to do is type in their return as

50
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,090
we've taped him before in the main and
we can just a peer a plus being that's

51
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:58,060
it that's all we need to do we we can
you can of course rate in more complex

52
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,220
code but for the title just use this as
a demonstration and now just a pin

53
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:32,510
see out here and i cant AP in five and
five is over here so some and then open

54
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:42,710
parentheses and here would type in mypin
35 colon

55
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:49,400
and let's go ahead pile that

56
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,540
the sum of three and five is this is
basically the simplest example I could

57
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,479
give of pretty much the simplest
function I could think up so it has a

58
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:05,759
return type of double it will return a
doubled and we have named it sum you

59
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,130
could you can pretty much do you want as
long as you use lowercase uppercase

60
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:20,050
letters underlines and then you have a
double do double values inside 2002

61
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,240
double types inside this or not they
don't have we have not a site that

62
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,310
values when we passed a min like this so
just instead of writing this in here we

63
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:37,620
take in two values into a is substituted
with 3d is given a value of three and

64
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:45,380
the is given a value of 5 which in turn
is placed here which in turn is here

65
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:53,160
here there are added and did that value
is returned so you can write these

66
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,349
functions for division and subtraction
and pretty much all the functionalities

67
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:04,370
of week out later this is how to calc
leaders are made you have a series of

68
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,010
these functions for every one of those
options here actually with me just

69
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:28,110
calculator here

70
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,870
there we go so you have some basic
functions here but if we switch to

71
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,600
scientific you have a lot more so you
have these mathematical function here

72
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,180
cosine sine tension accept all of those
functions have a mathematical

73
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:51,850
representation which in turn is written
like this this would be for example of

74
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,100
function to add two numbers you could
also write more complex mathematical

75
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,930
functions if that's something that you
would be interested in what we gonna do

76
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,760
that now primarily because we needed and
something is eating up my CPU well

77
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,320
apparently not just a slow virtual
machine anyway

78
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,670
get so that would be one of them let's
go ahead and deal with something else so

79
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:25,510
you can also have a void function which
can do do something for you but it

80
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,140
doesn't necessarily need to return a
number or anything about it doesn't need

81
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:38,040
to return a value so let's call this one

82
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:48,150
know what squalid welcome welcome and
we're not gonna get any arguments but we

83
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:59,700
definitely can if we would like to do
might do that a bit later on as in

84
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,820
voided doesn't return anything empty
function of course there are things that

85
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,460
get the idea just saying that it cannot
return a number in mind and we can just

86
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,880
a pins see out

87
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:31,750
well to somewhere where I have no idea

88
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:40,200
ok so let's put a semicolon the and and
let's go ahead call this function down

89
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:47,000
below us see actual

90
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:56,680
but actually one would think here soon
as something this is so much to show you

91
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,290
and i got a compressive welcome does not
work

92
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:09,300
why does it not work or what is the
problem let's go ahead and take a look

93
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,820
so

94
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:22,680
configuration parameters church and void

95
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:38,970
ok ok ok so we are this is able to
actually deal with that but if I was

96
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,520
start explaining it that would be
hilarious take forever but this is

97
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,380
actually pretty stupid this would be the
equivalent of me typing in just take a

98
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,950
look at what I did I'm gonna write an
example of why did they basically roads

99
00:10:52,950 --> 00:11:01,860
see out and then something and then
again see out and then again something

100
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:10,910
statement something just some random
text so this is pretty stupid of my part

101
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,089
on my part

102
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:16,040
let's go ahead and just delete see out
because we literally have no need for it

103
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,790
we can just call the function on its own
and it will print out whatever we can to

104
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,820
protect and there you go

105
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:38,270
welcome to somewhere where no idea let's
go ahead and tell here for center

106
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:46,170
so it has three and 58 welcome to
somewhere I have no idea where if you

107
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:57,070
wanted to do vote like this you would
need to get of course would need to be a

108
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:03,770
stream so a function that returns a
string string is also another type of a

109
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:11,050
variable which can contain basically as
I said spaces contain lots of letters

110
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,600
can pretty much tape in what ever you
want

111
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:27,700
distinguished sure let's call it of
course X and we're going to give it a

112
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:39,400
dream X gonna give it these ring X
before we actually put it we will ask

113
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:52,920
the user kindly see out and what ever
you would like

114
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:06,200
yeah actually do in a different sense
well done and then we taped in C and

115
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,720
again we would need a some sort of a
string in our main function because when

116
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,380
you define a variable inside a function
somewhere that variable is only valid

117
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,750
for it that particular function there so
let's go ahead and take the in string x

118
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,320
I can call this one again by the same
name but it doesn't have any relation to

119
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:33,400
these three X in the function welcome
here just leave it as it is and I will

120
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,560
take the end

121
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:48,050
see in X and will actually need a
different on like this

122
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:55,410
get line

123
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,040
so this should work

124
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,680
decline is one of those functions that's
embedded into C++ and it will use in

125
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,790
order to insert a whole line not just a
single character and that's pretty much

126
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:15,319
all you need to know about Sealine this
is its syntax you type in get low I need

127
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:24,209
a P&C in here and the newspaper stream
here these text manipulation things will

128
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:28,899
come in handy later on we deal with a
keylogger and down below

129
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,269
we're gonna go ahead and see see well
come and we shall pass

130
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:39,910
expedite function that's actually so
it's just go ahead

131
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:47,699
oh this look so the sum of three and
five is eight enter whatever you would

132
00:14:47,699 --> 00:15:04,740
like high here or take a wild guess
their ego it says hi I am here or am I

133
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:14,420
take a wild guess there are several new
things here basically the deadline which

134
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,149
we just need to see the syntax of it
that's pretty much it you don't need to

135
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,430
completely understand it there is a
whole background to this function and

136
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:28,459
you have these sort of functions which
are basically just return types and you

137
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:32,720
type in the name whatever you like
pretty much and specify the return type

138
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,019
in front of this fun this return type
strain it will return a string string x

139
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:46,870
and that that X will be given to it by
the user input so this is like an echo

140
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,899
something and it just gets printed back
on the screen

141
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:58,680
fairly simple no lot of complications
and just show you that

142
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,000
this would work without me actually
importing anything it doesn't really

143

matter he doesn't need to have a X I can
do this this this just say return and

144
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:31,529
then how is it going are you showing a
totally see myself spending a lot of

145
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:58,610
things here to the horse is you use the
slide my subliminal message that is

146
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,740
supposed to be like hidden in his number
should do any harm

147
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:17,520
so go ahead and start over the program
oh yes of course sorry to see out we

148
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:26,410
need something printed out because we've
got from function and there we go

149
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,630
hey how's it going are you enjoyed the
chorus please do not have used the

150
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,990
knowledge and at this particular
function here says just turn that is all

151
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,990

these things

152

no big deal so we have charged and we

157
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:26,320
have a string which we can play around
with complex things because we will need

158
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,540
strength that there'll be a lot of pics
with a keylogger and there's no way of

159
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,310
doing it without strings or jars anyway

160
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,280
