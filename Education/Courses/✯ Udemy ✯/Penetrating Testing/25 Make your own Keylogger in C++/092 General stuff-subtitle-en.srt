1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome all to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Today I'm making an addition to the course

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,200
and there has been a lot of demands for a lot of different things.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,000
I will keep on adding them as time keeps passing by.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,990
This is a progressive course

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,000
so the content just keeps getting added as long as there is demand for it.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now in this particular edition, I have decided to teach you more about keyloggers.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,400
So here I will show you how you can make a keylogger, which will record key strokes elsewhere

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,000
and then later on, we will get into the deployment techniques for a keylogger

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,300
I already demonstrated some of the deployment techniques in the previous tutorials

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,200
that are general purpose

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,300
but these things will be very specific to a keylogger

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,200
even though they can easily be adapted to other malicious pieces of code.

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,310
Anyway, address here is is the fact that we will start to do some really advanced things here

15
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,290
here and you're going to probably
encounter a lot of errors

16
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:20,350
a lot of problems along the way so
that's natural especially because we're

17
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,920
moving into more advanced stuff and
merely because you yourselves are doing

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,990
to be making a keylogger several things
to take into consideration so several

19
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,950
prerequisites that we need to keep in
mind and before I gone any further let

20
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,110
me just say that we're not going to
actually do anything technical in this

21
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:47,360
tutorial urologists talk about what we
will need what will our setup be and for

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,670
what environment is this particular
keylogger meant for so I have decided to

23
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,719
create a keylogger for a Windows PC so
it doesn't matter that much

24
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:06,409
which version of Windows are you running
so it can be pretty much he 781

25
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:12,379
even ten you have it doesn't really
matter but we will be creating a

26
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:17,739
keylogger 40 Windows PC why have I
decided to create a keylogger that will

27
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:23,690
work on Windows well let's face it most
of the desktop users will be using

28
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,370
windows and deploying a keylogger on a
Windows or Mac is significantly more

29
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,660
difficult so we might get into that
later on

30
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,420
indeed course but for the time being I
will show you I want to show you how you

31
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:46,879
can meet a keylogger that will get you
can in fact a Windows PC with so here

32
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,349
are some of the things that we will need
first of all we will need a virtual

33
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:55,760
machine off windows I know that there
are a lot of Mac users that are

34
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,129
attending a course you don't have to buy
windows or anything of the kind you can

35
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:05,359
score to the Microsoft website you do
need to register and then you can get

36
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:11,930
one to three month trial period three
months is more than you really need some

37
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:18,650
90 days is really need to finish this up
to finish this to follow through this

38
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:25,489
tutorial I am NOT encouraging piracy or
anything like that but because you can

39
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,220
get like an IUD free trial so there is
no need to download from the torrents or

40
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,780
anything of a kind of get cracked
versions on Torrance I wouldn't

41
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:40,430
recommend them why I really don't know
what somebody has embedded into those

42
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,400
systems somebody could have altered them
to serve a malicious purpose when you

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,099
sold the monitor system or something of
a kind

44
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,370
therefore I really really really would
recommend doing that and there really

45
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,419
isn't any need you can just go over to
the Microsoft website register and

46
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:00,919
download pretty much any Windows you
would like a recommended be at least

47
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:08,870
seven and shouldn't really download
anything below seven I mean people still

48
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,220
use some people still use four-star a
lot of people still use XP contrary to

49
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,510
popular belief that it's extinguished
that its extinct

50
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,430
but I wouldn't recommend downloading
data systems just go ahead and download

51
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:29,130
7 and above though if you can get 8.1
and you can it's free you can get a free

52
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:34,110
Windows itself is not free for you would
have to pay for a permanent license bird

53
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,520
for a trial period

54
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,710
anybody can download and evaluate anyway
I have also opted not to demonstrate how

55
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,520
you can download windows and install
Aditya VirtualBox why

56
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,060
well all you need to do is go to be
Windows web site to a Microsoft Windows

57
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,210
web site and download from there pretty
simple if you encounter any problems or

58
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,010
difficulties there just let me know I
will design tutorial specifically for

59
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,120
dad I can do that quite fast played on
there is a need

60
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,370
pretty much most of the student pool

61
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:16,600
windows so you already installed at once
ideas and how to do it by now if you

62
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,250
don't it's ok just let me know in the
discussions in European or something of

63
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,220
a kind and I will create an additional
story award at the procedure for

64
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,240
installation which in VirtualBox is
exactly the same as for any other system

65
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,980
the dust that we have installed as far
into virtual box there is literally no

66
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,910
difference just downloaded and installed
to virtual box like before so all these

67
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:47,410
things are already short for other
operating systems they were there are no

68
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:56,580
significant differences for Windows it's
pretty much the same but as I said you

69
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,530
find it very difficult to reach
challenging just let me know and I will

70
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,410
do a specific demonstration here when
watching that I would like to address

71
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,020
before I continue on that is not really
related to the subject is the discussion

72
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,120
section and the private messages so I
would advise everybody who is pushing

73
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,540
destroyed by this point of time if you
came this far radical to post your

74
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,460
questions in the public discussions so
if a solution is found your problem for

75
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,840
malicious all that everybody can see it
regardless of that if you send me a PMI

76
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,910
will help you

77
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,310
either way so whether it's a PMR with it
and public discussions I will help you

78
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,750
either way so no worries there but if
you could it would be very nice if you

79
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,600
could please all your problems in the
discussion section where they are

80
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:54,170
visible to an accessible by all also
there are a lot of discussions again on

81
00:06:54,170 --> 00:07:02,160
average 25 increase in 12 hours that's a
lot if I by some chance miss one or

82
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,590
something like that

83
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:10,390
go ahead and send you p.m. and a link to
their discussions hehe my problem and I

84
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:16,290
will address it immediately I am really
sorry I generally don't you to save

85
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,980
have answered like 95% of the question
so dear but there are 25 percent always

86
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,140
that I'm missing somewhere in the fridge
or these one percent that perhaps on the

87
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,900
table saw were something of a kind but
as I said if you don't get an answer

88
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,450
within 12 or 24 up to 24 hours usually
eaten within 12 you don't get it up to

89
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:39,000
24 just send a private message and I
will address your problem immediately

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,560
anyway so before we go into next
tutorial I would advise you to install I

91
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,020
would advise you to install a virtual
machine of Windows if you already have

92
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,750
Windows running a physical machine there
is no strict requirement that you should

93
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:05,419
install of you then it's recommended you
do it

94
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:10,050
gonna be running a lot of code and India
later tutorials will also be running

95
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,700
some destructive code that you on your
main system and instead you want mister

96
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:23,880
p.m. and you can reinstall it easily if
you can't fix the problem so that's it

97
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,180
as far as that is concerned now on to
the requirements so as I said neither

98
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,590
windows continuing with the requirements
actually do windows aside from that will

99
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:40,050
need to go ahead and download an IDE
integrated development environment a

100
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,580
place where we will do the code where we
will do

101
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:49,560
coating we will create our own key
logger and aside from that rule Sony

102
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:56,160
Decompiler something to actually compile
the code to create to create machine

103
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,550
create something that a machine can
understand from what we taken from what

104
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:07,490
we use the user can understand and that
would be it's obviously windows I D and

105
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,380
pilot those three things we're going to
need for an idea I have chosen to use

106
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,980
Eclipse I will show you how to install
it set up in all of that later dorial

107
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:21,390
but it will have some requirements so
you will need to download e you will

108
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,420
need to download stuff from Java which I
will also show and demonstrate no

109
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,550
worries there but it's all free so you
won't need to pay for anything is there

110
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:34,890
no way no additional costs at all the
programming language that I have chosen

111
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:42,680
to use is C++ code for Windows is
written in C++ on top of that C++ has

112
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,850
the lowest amount dependencies for
example if you are going to run each

113
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:54,020
other code you need any job opening in
the backgrounds of somebody doesn't have

114
00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:01,030
a Java Runtime Environment as it is
called running under Windows PCs Java

115
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,320
code will not work Java is also a
programming language like C++ is a

116
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:12,480
programming language if you some other
programming languages like Python again

117
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,370
on Windows you're gonna have a lot of
dependencies are pretty much whatever

118
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:26,170
you use aside from ABC sharp and C++ and
C you will have a condo defenses which

119
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,470
you're going to need to worry about
because you do not know what is

120
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,740
installed on somebody else's EC you need
to create something that will

121
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,730
universally work on pretty much all the
PCs that are running the Windows

122
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,190
environment regardless of what they have
installed on your PC with India

123
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,060
operating system that is why that is one
of the main reasons why actors and C++

124
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,330
and usually hacking code and stuff like
that idea scripting language for

125
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,150
something simple or complex work like a
keylogger

126
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:03,550
its C or C++ example if you used ceded
nearly in the Linux demean as Linux is

127
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:12,220
mostly written in C when it says anyway

128
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:20,800
C++ can be can be tedious can be
difficult can it syntax can be complex

129
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,590
and don't give up immediately just
follow the tutorial tutorials I want

130
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:31,540
skip any steps I will show you how it is
done one step at a time with no steps

131
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,160
skipped and you will be able to see each
line of the code as you make it then

132
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,650
each line of the code will be explained
so you will have an understanding of it

133
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,060
before we can actually get into writing
a keylogger we will set up the

134
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,700
environment and eight unique to first of
all introduce you to some basic things

135
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:55,010
about C++ so I will introduce you to see
the basic things there and then we

136
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,780
wanted more advanced things through the
process of creating agree keylogger so

137
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:05,870
learned by doing however I would also
advise you to use external material you

138
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,900
have a lot of videos on C++ subject on
youtube so if you expand your knowledge

139
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,810
there and take a look at some additional
things you have the discussions don't

140
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,510
necessarily need to ask if you have a
problem if you don't understand

141
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:26,980
something go ahead and ask I'll be happy
to help you out in any way I can

142
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,130
anyway that is what is waiting for us
here so you will learn how to make a

143
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,510
keylogger ourselves and hopefully you'll
be able to modify it any way you like

144
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,970
this longer will be talking to be a
professional one or something like that

145
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:46,130
but it will be able to serve the purpose
that we needed to serve furthermore

146
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,930
writing custom code as opposed to just
under three key logger from the net does

147
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:58,480
have tremendous advantages primarily
because antivirus detection one of the

148
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,780
waste of within her selection is to rate
custom code as simple as possible and

149
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,410
have it for yourself and there's nobody
else has a 10 the security companies

150
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,790
that weekend hours program

151
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,470
know about it and even though they have
some general detection methods they will

152
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,500
not have any dick specific detection
methods for your piece of code so keep

153
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,490
that in mind if you wud of August on the
net

154
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,940
especially their closed source you have
no idea what you're done duty I mean

155
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:32,350
even if you buy one again the company ok
city around with such things but you

156
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,590
still have no idea what you are down
there you have to be really really

157
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,750
really careful with that on the other
hand if you make yourselves you know

158
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,820
exactly what is in there you know
exactly what it does you have for

159
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,560
understanding of it and a lot of people
have asked me to show you as a lot of

160
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,970
advanced stuff a lot of advanced things
and I decided to begin with Dad first

161
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:58,240
tutorial from this the series of the
series of advanced been testing let's

162
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,390
put it so will be how to make your own
key logger and then later on we will go

163
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,770
into some other interests

164
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,760
more interesting stuff so to see however
until next tutorial I bid you farewell

165
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,120
and I wish you a ton of luck with this
