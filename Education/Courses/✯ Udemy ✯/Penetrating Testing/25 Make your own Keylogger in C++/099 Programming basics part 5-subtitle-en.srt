1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome all to this tutorial.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,700
Today I will talk about pointers and files.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,000
After that, we will go straight into actually writing the code for a keylogger.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We will begin writing our keylogger.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,700
So you are only two subjects away and one tutorial away

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,700
from writing a real keylogger that will actually record keystrokes.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:32,500
Please keep in mind that initially, I will try to either create it myself

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,820
or just find one on the net that is really really really really simple.

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,000
I mean the most basic of the basic, so that you can only record keystrokes

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,100
and then we will try to expand upon it.

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:53,500
We will keep on adding functions to it and we will see how far we will actually go.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,200
Anyway, let's go ahead and take a look at this.

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,120
So one of the things that you will basically know are what pointers are.

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,970
Basically days store memory
addresses of other the store memory

15
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:16,330
addresses of other variables that's it
no big deal there the way you would use

16
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,860
it the way you would use pointers in the
most simple of example in the simplest

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,740
possible example later on you'll do more
complex examples as we start programming

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,990
the keylogger but for the time being
i'll just keep it simple would take p.m.

19
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,799
let's let's declare a variable first
let's create a variable number let's

20
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,530
sign it a value of

21
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:45,520
so now we would like to create a pointer
that points to dis variable how do we do

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,229
that we'll we basically just ok we take
a look at this and let's disassemble it

23
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,649
so this is a type in this is an integer
it heard variable has a name of number

24
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,890
and it has an assigned value of ten ok

25
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,520
in order to create a pointer that points
to it needs to be at the same time so in

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,250
and then that Asterix and then we give
it a name so we can do whatever we like

27
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:22,900
pretty much gonna go ahead in the image
PTR so isn't point the Dr's pointer and

28
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,640
then afterwards we tell it we actually
need to tell it to actually point to

29
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,170
this variable so how do we do that we
take in PTR sequels and we need to open

30
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:52,830
a 10 percent sign and percent sign
that's the memory address of P TR this

31
00:02:52,830 --> 00:03:06,489
year ago now let's go ahead and write
Dec out co2 instruction CEO and let's go

32
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:19,400
ahead and output well just separate
these two values that we will output the

33
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,410
value of PTR so to your ethically what
we want to do is for these two values

34
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,360
when they get out put it we would like
them to be the same in this case they

35
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:39,370
won't you'll see why their ego so is
stan is it is supposed to be a cleat

36
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:45,110
thing here this is things ok so it's one
thing to number

37
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,780
hexadecimal number regardless of the
fact that it has letters inside zero x

38
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,120
that simply specifies that this is a
exit the small number and then you have

39
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,570
hexadecimal numbers are go from go like
this

40
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:09,730
0123456789 and then ABC D

41
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:21,019
D E F after the last if I am mistaken
here price increases chance feel free to

42
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:31,889
hang me in discussions a way if you will
be the memory address of its not

43
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,729
particularly useful to us now it's
definitely not useful to us from you

44
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:42,419
really dis bridge let's put it like that
can be it has its uses

45
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,460
if we want to to output value of Nnamdi
assign value from them

46
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:56,530
well simple enough just a bit less
tricks here let's go ahead and run it

47
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:04,400
their ego so 10 and then you have colon
colon dead simple as that

48
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,699
no big deal now this is a very basic
example as I said later on we will go

49
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,639
through we will go we'll see some other
examples of how pointers are used and

50
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,180
hopefully as we as we go through the
process of the creation of the keylogger

51
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:27,139
you will be able to solidify what you
have learned thus far and learned a lot

52
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:37,450
of new things go ahead and delete this
ad we don't really need this for the

53
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,520
time being

54
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,090
let's go ahead and deal with files now
why do we need files what on earth are

55
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:50,440
we going to use them for a while if
we're going to make a keylogger we will

56
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,880
definitely need to know how to use files
because hey if you have a keylogger

57
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:04,270
buddy system you will be storing those
particular files where we'll use toward

58
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,160
the keys so where will you store the
keys that are typed in the keyboard well

59
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:17,289
to file and somebody presses I don't
ABCD ABCD will be written to a file

60
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:21,050
somewhere you see how it stands to
reason

61
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,130
we need to know how to actually write to
a file using purely C++ and nothing else

62
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:33,650
this is a very simple process is not
very complicated it's very similar to

63
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:44,130
see out and see and you only need to do
up here is that include dream so that we

64
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:50,140
would be able to do this and let's go
ahead and deal with writing to a file

65
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:58,620
first we need to create an output stream
so it open or stream and we'll give it a

66
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,660
name right that seems the most logical
thing can write whatever you want here I

67
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:12,630
don't really care right and then let's
go ahead and get petition marks and go

68
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,610
ahead and yeah we need to specify the
path if you don't specify the path it

69
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:26,920
will be in your project folder so
they're Projects folder is here simply

70
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:35,070
if you didn't change anything it should
be here you click on local disk C users

71
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:42,610
creator well obviously for you you will
have a different username I'm just gonna

72
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,830
go ahead and click on mine so just go
ahead and click on the user name of the

73
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:52,970
user that you are using at the moment no
go ahead and look for work space

74
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,290
go ahead and click on it and look for
your project two years so our project is

75
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:04,850
a keylogger and it will pop you see
already have it from my test before but

76
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:12,740
in the least a decision needed so it
will be here just gonna minimized US

77
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:21,940
anyways let's go ahead and write and
specify our file path so they've been

78
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,490
see cooling

79
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,000
backslash backslash is an escape
character it used to escape the

80
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,770
quotation marks Sunni type in two
backslashes if you want to if you want

81
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,190
to see your beck / in the string that
that it's printed out in this sentence

82
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:48,620
in the statement where quality so see
colon slash slash users backslash

83
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:57,190
backslash again later and this is where
I would like to create this file in this

84
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:09,140
particular folder just see ok we will
create a huge need to pay attention you

85
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:15,399
give it a path and you me to make sure
that you can actually right there if you

86
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,940
can't write anything there won't be able
to create a file by the way this what we

87
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:33,040
have written here is the equivalent of
this so this is how the system this is

88
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,540
how the south will be for the system
because we have entered backslashes of

89
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,860
backslashes here so that the slashes
backslashes could be interpreted as such

90
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,899
as I stated backslashes our escape
characters so if you need some character

91
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:55,450
to escape these quotation marks and be
interpreted as a commander something of

92
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:00,040
a kind then you would tape in a
backslash let me show you what I mean by

93
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,290
that comment out this line just to make
sure there are no Asians here safe I

94
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:17,440
type in CEO and if I open up quotation
marks and if I type in text goes here

95
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:32,480
he's did you know and if I double
backslash year that I type in that

96
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,750
stands for a new line back / and for a
new alliance or skipping it and let's go

97
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,540
ahead and that some something else

98
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,910
random text goes here here in case you
didn't know

99
00:10:44,910 --> 00:11:02,400
case you did did their ego just go ahead
and do this so there are no end else

100
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:09,660
here and there is justice escape
character with its guidance in this

101
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,620
command around here

102
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:22,260
random text goes here in case you did
not know in case you did write something

103
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:31,890
that we will be using some of this later
on as well and do dis

104
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:39,000
FileStream right and doubt we need to
actually write something to that file

105
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,450
well how do we do take a wild guess just
type in right

106
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:53,510
pretty much the same as see out and
let's go ahead and take some text here

107
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,780
alright I knew I was forgetting
something when I was looking at this we

108
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:08,110
need to provide the name of the file so
our final thought txt a wonderful if

109
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,520
needed I forgot oh well things happen
when you program you will encounter more

110
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,470
than one problem but just forgetting
things right so what should we put into

111
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,329
this text file

112
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:55,059
windows in it like all the freedom to
read the statement late so much says

113
00:12:55,059 --> 00:13:01,709
anyway you can do this but I did now so
see that the quotation marks are here

114
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:06,860
and then you can just press Enter going
to do you live and then add quotation

115
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,769
marks here this is all the same line to
the computer you're just doing this for

116
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:21,689
your self gate so let's go ahead and
let's go ahead and compiling renders yes

117
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,220
go ahead

118
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:33,049
errors but there's a semicolon of course
does it in preventing out of the screen

119
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:38,040
so we need to actually because we didn't
tell it out

120
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,709
need to actually go ahead and check and
this is the folder is hella see if we

121
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:49,029
can find that their ego it says our
final da txt says we also I like working

122
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:54,999
in it I like all the freedom that I
haven't had as in it as opposed to Linux

123
00:13:54,999 --> 00:14:10,189
field for the space there now gonna do
it let's do a test run so you see this

124
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:15,980
is all one line if item for the space
here or here it's just interpreted as

125
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:24,439
one single I as being together those
faces but now I have a stasi up their

126
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:32,360
ego as opposed to sex oK so that's how
you write to a file at the end you

127
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,329
should always close the file

128
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:40,309
to close the file you don't have a
built-in function in just a bit right so

129
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:46,269
whatever you've typed in whatever you
named it whenever you name this file

130
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:58,629
stream just go ahead and use that
thought is no need is a need to Lowes

131
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:03,920
there we go this will effectively closed
the file you can't actually see this

132
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,129
happening but that's something to do if
you do this you can save yourself a lot

133
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:15,249
of trouble a lot of headaches actually
later on anyway let's go ahead and

134
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:19,489
delete this as we no longer need it now
let's figure out how we can actually

135
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:24,600
read from a file so this is what I will
just do the basic reading from a file

136
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,029
that big deal later on we will need to
do lou combine this with loops

137
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,689
continuous loops if we will need to
combine it with infinite loop so that

138
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:40,369
actually reads through the whole file
continuously for the time being I just

139
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:46,089
put a show you how you can read an
individual character from a line from a

140
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:51,879
file that's it nothing else I would you
do this well you would need to tape in

141
00:15:51,879 --> 00:16:17,620
input file with the name of your choice
let's give it a path again see users

142
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:27,770
I'll txt ever go and how do you read
from this well you need of first full

143
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,940
year of 2005

144
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:40,529
variable which store it's raining down
below we will take in read greater

145
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:46,260
denigrated ensign read it in to exploit
this will only read the first word into

146
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:58,460
X it will reach only until the first
space capsule and sea salt please help

147
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:10,250
protects let's go ahead and run this
window so that was the first word it

148
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:19,120
interpreted that

149
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,920
see Windows the first word and then we
have a space here later on show you how

150
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,360
you can read the whole file

151
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,240
regardless of its length regardless of
how many spaces there are regardless of

152
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,990
the length and so on and so forth some
very complicated you need to create a

153
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,290
loop and know how to handle it

154
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:46,500
we will of course do this because we
will need to read from a file and write

155
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,990
to a file as well for our key logger
because that will be a place for a

156
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,090
keylogger stores the information that we
need to figure out what we want to do

157
00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:00,429
with that information whether we want to
send it somewhere or not we will decide

158
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:06,600
to actually send it somewhere anyway I'm
gonna be your farewell here until the

159
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:14,059
next tutorial in the desert or actually
going to start creating our first

160
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:19,830
keylogger that will be really really
really simple really primitive and we'll

161
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,700
see how that works out then from there
from that point on we can start adding

162
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,190
some features well anyway goodbye
