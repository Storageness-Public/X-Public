1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,159
Okay, so welcome everybody

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:04,900
First -- To this tutorial

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,560
and second -- Today we're gonna go ahead

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,500
and see how we can filter out all sorts of characters.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,900
For example, people tend to use exclamation marks in their passwords

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,200
or asterisks

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,800
or, I don't know, a symbol for a British pound

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,000
or, I don't know, something else.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Whatever

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,500
They tend to use these symbols in their passwords.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Although not a lot of people tend to do this.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,050
Most people tend just type in some sort of a name or word from the dictionary

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,700
and a few numbers, unless the service on the other side

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,800
is actually forcing them to use lower or upper case characters, etc

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,610
Now we need to deal with these things

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,500
and how shall we deal with them?

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,840
Well, think of it this way --

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,000
What do you have to press on the keyboard to get an exclamation mark?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,400
Depending on what sort of keyboard do you use

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,000
I suppose...

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I think this is actually pretty universal

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So for an exclamation mark , it's shift 1

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,600
and then you get an exclamation mark

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,939
and we need to make a statement, which would recognize the state to the shift key

25
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:23,000
and if the shift key is pressed and if the value is the ascii value of 1 the keyboard

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
then please do not type in 1

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,200
Rather instead, please type in an exclamation mark.

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,300
So let's go about solving this problem.

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,000
Now there's going to be quite a good deal of these things

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,479
Perhaps an "if" statement is not the most efficient one here.

31
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:47,300
Rather instead we will combine the if and switch statements

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,000
in order to get a better efficiency.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So let's go ahead and type in "else"

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,500
and then ENTER

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,000
Open up these curly brackets

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,600
Let's go ahead and do this.

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,400
Write a switch statement

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,500
as I have shown you previously.

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,500
So just key here

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,200
and there we go

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,200
So let's deal with these cases one by one.

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:26,000
"case"

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, just give me a moment...

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:46,400
So this case will feature when the value of the key is basically the ascii value of 1

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,000
and let's take a look at the ASCII table for 1

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
"ASCII table"

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,600
So which one is it for 1?

48
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,500
For 1, it's actually 49

49
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,200
Probably shouldn't been on 0

50
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,310
Doesn't really matter

51
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,300
We can add it

52
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,800
I just wanna show you a demonstration.

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,700
So it's 49

54
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,800
Where is it?

55
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,800
49 it is

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Okay, so case 49 shall go like this.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,000
"if"

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,500
We need to create the overrides.

59
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:43,500
So "if (Get)"...

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,600
Oh forget about this

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,800
I'm just gonna go ahead and copy/paste it

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,200
because I'm terrible at writing these things down.

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:04:00,000
So all we want is the state of the shift key.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,800
The hex value is 10

65
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:11,800
(ex10) symbolizes that it is a hexadecimal number

66
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
and you would write them in here

67
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Like this

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,500
This is the hex value for it anyway.

69
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:25,800
If this is true, I would like you to do this -

70
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,240
write << "!" ;

71
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:40,500
and just go ahead...

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,200
Well, we can either close the file or not here.

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,580
I'll probably make this a little bit prettier, but for the time being

74
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,970
I just wanna do a demonstration of how this works.

75
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:57,000
So let's press CTRL F11

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,500
Okay, there's one keylogger running in the background.

77
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's go ahead and end the task.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,500
Let's run it one more time.

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,900
Okay, so it is running.

80
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's go ahead and type in some exclamation marks.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
HEYthere

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Open up our log file

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and there we go.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
So it's says...

85
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,800
Okay, this is from my previous statements...

86
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,200
Okay, so this is the the current one.

87
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,200
So exclamation marks

88
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,000
and HEYthere at the end.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,900
Anyway, we're gonna go ahead and select this file and cleanse it.

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,000
Purify it

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,800
So I don't have any more of these distractions

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,500
and now, from this point on

93
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,200
we just need to keep on building on this switch statement.

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,000
So we're gonna have a lot of cases

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,600
and this will allow us to customize our key logger

96
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,000
towards a keyboard that we would like

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,400
or you know, generally.

98
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,400
So even if somebody has keys configured differently

99
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,700
it does affect you

100
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,709
but it does not affect you to that extent.

101
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:30,439
I mean, how many different variations can you have

102
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,000
with, let's say the Shift 1?

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,200
Two, at max

104
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,300
So you have two possibilities

105
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,200
and it has to be one of the two

106
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,000
even though somebody has a different keyboard layout, perhaps.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,300
It's not an exclamation mark.

108
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,600
Maybe it's a tilde key, or something of a kind

109
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
That's what I see on my keyboard, anyway.

110
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,400
That is a possibility

111
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,000
So just take a look at your keyboards.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,400
I mean literally just pick it up, take a look, and see the numbers from 0 to 1

113
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,800
Well, actually the way they're laid out in the upper portion so the keyboard

114
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,500
it's from 1 to 0

115
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,300
It goes like this -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, and then you have a 0

116
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,000
and you take a look at these numbers

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,200
and then you take a look at these keys, these physical keys

118
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,200
and see what's drawn on them, and look --

119
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,700
There aren't that many possibilities

120
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,200
I see three things that are drawn on each one of them

121
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,000
One of those three things is a number

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,900
and the other one is a standard thing, which you would use with Shift

123
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,100
and the other one is some other symbol that can be used as well

124
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,700
that's kind of configured, but rarely anybody uses that.

125
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,000
They usually use other portions of their keyboards for those symbols

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
which we are going to deal with here.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So anyway, in the follow-up tutorial

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,500
I perhaps won't be doing as much talking

129
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,100
as I will do the writing out of this long switch statement.

130
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,349
There are two portions of this switch statement --

131
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:04,000
One is for a these special characters

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,300
well, if you want to call them special characters

133
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,479
and the other one is for our keyboard

134
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,060
is for, let's say Tab

135
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,000
and we need to incorporate Caps Lock somewhere around here as well

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,210
and if you want to

137
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,000
what we want to be written up when we press Shift

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We don't want anything to be written out

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,819
or when you press Ctrl or Alt, and so forth and so forth

140
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,700
but in any case, this is the approach that I'm going to take.

141
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,180
It's not the prettiest of approaches

142
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,800
but it's the one that's the simplest understand.

143
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,029
So look, we have case checking

144
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:45,200
which we need to upgrade

145
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,300
We will do that in the follow-up tutorial, most likely

146
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,000
with the Caps Lock as well

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,700
and down here, we have the else statement

148
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,400
which just translates into a switch statement

149
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:02,000
in such a way we have interconnected this entire condition check

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,279
and then in the switch statement

151
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,000
we're gonna have a good amount of cases

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,600
which will be custom to deal with particular keys

153
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,800
to get proper output when you press a certain key.

154
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,459
So Shift 1

155
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,800
we wanted to give an exclamation mark.

156
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,700
Shift 2 -- We wanted to give a quotation mark.

157
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,000
Shift 3...well, I have no idea what Shift 3 is.

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,800
Okay, so it's British pound

159
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,000
and Shift 4, it's a dollar sign

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,380
and Shift 5, it's a percentage sign

161
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,800
