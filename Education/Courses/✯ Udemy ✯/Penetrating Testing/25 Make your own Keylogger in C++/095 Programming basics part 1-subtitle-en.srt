00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Welcome all to this tutorial.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,000
Today I will go ahead and begin the crash course C++

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,700
Keep in mind that we will mainly learn things that will be of to us in order to create a keylogger

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,700
but before we can get into the creation of the keylogger

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,700
we have to go through some basic things

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,500
so that you would actually understand the code that you see before yourselves

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,000
I will give you fairly good explanations of what I am doing here

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,600
and of some basic terms that you will need

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,300
and then later on, as we keep on progressing through the creation of the keylogger

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,320
you will learn more and more and more and more

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,200
until eventually you pretty much figure it all out.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,200
Now let's go ahead and begin, shall we?

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,030
Last time you saw a program hello world run printed out

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,570
something onto the screen now let's see
let's let's let's go ahead and try to

15
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:10,780
understand the first of all you have
this includes statement here and it says

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:17,810
basically iostream include your
including libraries and other things

17
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,200
yeah so libraries and other things I
know how it sounds

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,470
believe me that is all you need to know
for the time being basically the

19
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,390
contents of this file just comes in
front of the main function and it's

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,600
taken into consideration by the program
why do we need this well so that we can

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,280
write see out we wouldn't be able to
rate see out without iostream also slash

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,070
slash is a comment line so it just means
that that particular line will not be

23
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,479
taken into consideration by the system
that's just something that we use as

24
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,219
reference for our cells and four other
people who read through the code you can

25
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,140
also use multi comment multi-line
comments like this just write in a

26
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,270
stream

27
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:14,080
/ Asterix and then at the end rate in
Asterix / and that all that intersection

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,550
will be taken will be taken out of the
consideration by the machine over here

29
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,110
you see it immediately says that it
immediately gives you a red underline of

30
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,410
see out doesn't recognize it because we
have commented out this library so let's

31
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:39,380
go ahead and delete this and see out is
perfectly fine and dandy now except it's

32
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,910
missing a few things that we will take
in now so tape in less and less than

33
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,890
sign a pin

34
00:02:45,890 --> 00:03:08,320
hey hey it is for its 4 o'clock at my
place now and awake if we just go ahead

35
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,100
and press Enter

36
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:18,470
2010 we need a semicolon Germany and
Karen 02 pretty much finished program go

37
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:26,970
ahead and take press Ctrl F 11 to Reddit
and every code it says hey it is 4

38
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,950
o'clock at my place and it's for plucked
my place now and I am awake so we've

39
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:41,240
successfully managed to print this onto
the screen now weekend go ahead and play

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:50,740
around with it a little bit of a pin and
Elton sir a new line but you need lesser

41
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:57,130
then lets you then and we can also do
this this the simple fact that we

42
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,060
pressed enter here does not mean that
program into the new line this is just

43
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,580
purely for aesthetic purposes for us it
makes no difference whatsoever

44
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,870
machine until we actually tell us and
you line with and L and now we can go

45
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:25,010
in Western Western Cape in another
sentence why awake now so that's it

46
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:30,650
going through going through there we go

47
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,880
says you have the initial state you have
the initial sentence which is here and

48
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,639
then you have and L and then you have
this just to make a point here

49
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:51,000
delete or if I just a pin can tell if I
just commented out can do dis going

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,280
through and you see now it's a single
line it makes no difference whatsoever

51
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,000
to replace this section in a different
line here until we actually tell the

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,580
program so that would be see out that's
how you print something out now they're

53
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,510
now if you want to insert something into
the system if you want to emphasize

54
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,039
something healthy certainly if you want
to put something you would use see in

55
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,330
but before we can actually go into sea
in just talking about a concept which is

56
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:28,210
common to all programming languages
which is variables which variables

57
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:36,889
variables are memory locations allocated
in ran that's their used in order to

58
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:45,280
store data basically you have a lot of
variables see a lot of variable types

59
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,970
let's put it so that the correct way of
putting it

60
00:05:48,970 --> 00:06:05,400
you have in low flow there are there are
there are others training and so on and

61
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:05,849
so forth

62
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,680
we're gonna get to do no worries there
but for the time being

63
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,099
let's deal with it so integers it just
basically just whole numbers meaning

64
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:21,590
12345 1010 billion in five

65
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:27,560
11 something like that so does would be
integers let's let's get let's create an

66
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:39,700
interview so in a equals then semicolon
and I could have also done this the

67
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:46,690
equals 20 all these places they're just
Julie first for aesthetic reasons

68
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:53,140
they're not needed by the program by the
machine you also have another variable

69
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:59,760
type which is a double those are numbers
with the small points so fight AP in C

70
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:09,170
equals ten-point 10.3% AP in D

71
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:25,120
the equals 62234 those would be doubles
next up if I type in Sialkot they close

72
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:45,220
attention here- see out enter the values
for a and B give it and we'll see and

73
00:07:45,220 --> 00:08:01,060
greater Denver greater than sign that in
mind and then we shall taken co2

74
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:27,060
values of a and B value of a space less
than less than and L because we would

75
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:53,330
like a new line of value apps be and we
need to do this so value of a is a and

76
00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:04,930
value of b is basically be and we don't
really needed here so I just go ahead

77
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:13,980
and put it like this icon and let's go
ahead and run the program

78
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,180
existent required project now this is
how well aside from just knowing that

79
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,830
scenario where tells you that you go and
take a look at the code and you go and

80
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:30,850
take a look at the lines close to the
one where you have a red X mark so let's

81
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,940
see what what sort of mistake did we
meet here so first thought can you

82
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,370
spotted just take a look it's in this
line for sure it doesn't always the

83
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,430
Sunni to be it can be in the preceding
lines lines that come afterwards but

84
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,890
take a look in see out is that of using
less than less than we used greater

85
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:58,490
denigrated n so just changed out and it
should run now so enter the values for

86
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,649
A&B go ahead and tape in 50 and then
take pain

87
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:15,589
30 value fee is 50 value of b is 38 UCC
AC even do we have assigned values we

88
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:20,230
could have we've reassigned be
reassigned him with user input so the

89
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:27,379
user has placed seven different values
here and we can also changed is to be a

90
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:45,040
bit premier just a entered value and to
develop you of a just and after you have

91
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:59,779
entered the value of a you can hear

92
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:21,170
ok so rigid and greeted n entered the
value be and do dis yeah we will need

93
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,949
and L and I will explain in a moment

94
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:37,459
CNNA and now we need to enter B C in B
let's run the program to see if

95
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:47,240
everything works well it says enter the
value of a but since replaced and the

96
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,399
new lie here maybe that wasn't the
brightest the fight years ok and enter

97
00:11:52,399 --> 00:12:00,470
the value of b which is going to be no
it so it's as the value of a stand value

98
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:06,949
of b is eighty so made a slight slip up
in aesthetics here we can feel free to

99
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:14,899
remove death part and have a prettier
output

100
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:24,649
value fee one of B will be to go anyway
what did we do here we rode see how to

101
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:31,100
print something out to screen so console
out and see in console in and we've

102
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,220
printed out onto screen enter the value
of a and since we didn't actually type

103
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,089
in any new alliance printing like that
here the next position to enter anything

104
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:46,309
would be simply straight effort to text
you saw the output when I typed in and

105
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:51,709
tell you has taken the value below the
text next up you have seen in ages

106
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:56,559
consul in to improve the value of a you
are asking the user to input and the

107
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,100
program is standing by for the user to
input about you down below

108
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:07,559
again we've printed out and to the value
of b and it's just new lines for

109
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:12,980
anything of a kind so it's waiting for
the input of the user again with see it

110
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,569
once the boat once both values have been
entered we are able to print out of

111
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:26,959
value of a is a value of b be so if
something is in the quotation marks like

112
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,870
this we are just drinking debt out the
screen

113
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,490
no big deal there but if we just put a
variable legged is the value of that

114
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,079
very the value that is stored in that
variable will be printed out so the

115
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,679
value that is stored in a at this point
of time at this point of time into code

116
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:52,929
is whatever the user inputs before the
user input its then because we have a

117
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:58,610
slide then and then we had the user has
actually reassigned something else to

118
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,990
the value we didn't need to write them
here

119
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,820
printing of a kind we could have just
left it like this

120
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:15,920
this some garbage would be stored into
A&B because something always has to be

121
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,580
within those variables anyway that be

122
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:28,210
user input with CNN and user output and
standard output with C out we can go

123
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:35,630
ahead and well we don't necessarily to
delete them we will as we should recycle

124
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:40,490
the code as much as we can so use the
code if we've already taken somewhere in

125
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,770
the same time but oh well

126
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:51,370
gonna miss out on something now next up
we have math operators so what Matt

127
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,910
operators do you have in the real world
basically the same thing here plus minus

128
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:04,580
you have division multiplication and you
also have a modulus if you don't know

129
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,760
what modulus is basically when you
divide two numbers and whatever remains

130
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,550
that the modules for example if you
divide that number number five with

131
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:23,040
number to the result would be the result
will be basically two with the remainder

132
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,960
of one that's one way of looking at it
that remainder one that would be the

133
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:38,540
modulus a way we will use these shortly
but other than that but you also have

134
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,780
any comparison operators so the
comparison operators are equal equal

135
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,390
which means that we can put it like this

136
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:55,370
a is equal all to be we are we can use a
conditional statement if I will talk

137
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,130
about that shortly but I just wanna do
this first so a equals equals be which

138
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:09,620
means equal be if I just typed in 11
equation 1

139
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,370
11

140
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:18,910
equal sign a equals be all I would do
with this quite literally is a sign the

141
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,170
value of B to A and that's it

142
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,220
huge mistake usually made by pretty much
everybody people will be going for

143
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,630
twenty years they still make these
mistakes cuz they literally have to

144
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:35,160
stare at millions of lines of code so
it's a common area don't worry about it

145
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:47,370
next up we have exclamation mark equals
which means a is not equal to be in a

146
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:58,950
min rated in a is great libby is no less
than BB and that's pretty much it also

147
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:09,949
has also have things like and and and
and which basically stands for the word

148
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:23,120
and if you have some pole and then be
and these can be some sort of conditions

149
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:38,730
a is not equal 0 to see and be is not in
B is equal this would basically stayed

150
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:56,530
at this and this if you have example by
buy it for me in this or this so or

151
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:03,660
some very simple things there you can
use them in if statements which are

152
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:16,830
conditional statements basically this
obscure focus on if a is equal to be and

153
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:36,130
and then see is not equal to D then I
would like you to announce see well not

154
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:59,580
leap and if this else if that is not so
I would like to see out I will fight

155
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:16,500
against leaf semicolon here and we need
a semicolon here so do you see the logic

156
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,600
of this basically and stadium if this
condition of a Louise the true and it

157
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:29,660
will only evaluate the true if a is
equal to be and he is not equal to D

158
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:35,650
this will be printed out and this will
be disregard however this evaluates to

159
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:41,940
false so if either of these conditions
do conditions are not true so if a is

160
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:49,670
different from being if let's say 10 and
bees 2010 you're gonna go ahead and

161
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:56,260
execute this part the code and disregard
this part could have also placed the or

162
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:01,180
logical or here so this would mean that
only one of these two conditions would

163
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,510
have to be true in order for this
portion of the code

164
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,870
to run well shoot an example of this in
default store
