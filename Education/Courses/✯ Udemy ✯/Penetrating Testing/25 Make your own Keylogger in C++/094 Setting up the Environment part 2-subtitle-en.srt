1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Welcome back everybody

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,500
I have really done nothing here, other than just wait for it to finish

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,500
and that's it

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,400
and then you get prompted with this window here, once it is done.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,550
Yep, it's running in the background as well.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,500
It's just waiting for me to set a path for it.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,600
You can change it here.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,100
Don't. There is no need.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,700
Just go ahead and click on Next

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,300
3 Billion Devices Run Java

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,500
Yes, most of them smartphones/

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, so it's finishing...

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can feel free to read the text below if that entertains you.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,200
Anyway, successfully installed Java SE development kit.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,550
Click on Next Step to access tutorial, api documentation, etc.

16
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,800
We are not going to do that at the moment.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,410
So go ahead and click on Close

18
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,979
Now we have Java installed and we have a
compiler installed guess what your

19
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,320
journey has not ended in terms of
setting up your environment so we still

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,400
need to we still need to do a couple of
things here and one of them being is

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,170
that we need to set up our environment
variables and what I mean by that is the

22
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,420
following so in de Vigo to see see it
says here

23
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,950
GEW but nobody else on the system

24
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,829
nobody else but for example eclipses are
word integrated development environment

25
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:45,299
doesn't really know where W is it has no
idea of what so ever that is located

26
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,360
here also the PATH variable is w is not
included in the PATH variable and gonna

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,079
go ahead and show you what that is here
so just go ahead and click in the bottom

28
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,250
left

29
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:10,330
Warner go ahead and select system and
then we're going to go ahead and click

30
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,310
on advanced system settings by the way
maybe this is not the best way to

31
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,750
actually show it but away some of the
people might be using Windows seven or

32
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,770
later versions so this would be an
easier way to do it if you just go ahead

33
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:29,240
and open up your file explorer like this
you are here at this beginnings page so

34
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,610
go ahead and right click on this PC or
Mac computer which averages go ahead and

35
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,910
click on Properties click on Advanced
Settings button below it says

36
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:49,010
environment variables go into system
variables sell one random

37
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:56,550
press D and you will be directed to path
now let's go ahead and edited the

38
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,000
letters will be small here and that can
be annoying I know I will zoom in for

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,310
you so let's just show you what is
located here

40
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:20,340
notepad ok so this is something that we
will need to do in a moment I would

41
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:43,000
really like to open up another note pad
pasted increase a 15 year ago so want to

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,310
go to 22 well what's going on further
let's go let's be in knots let's go with

43
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:59,819
28 hopefully this is large enough for
everybody to see if extended to the end

44
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:06,580
of my screen is able to fit it basically
this first line is what you are what you

45
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,290
will be any the semicolon as well

46
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:17,470
your ass will look like this what you
need to do is control V in order to

47
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:24,620
control the answer to this so yours will
be something like this basically all of

48
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,600
these things it doesn't matter how it
looks like I don't really care all you

49
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,900
need to do is at the beginning just
insert this lines capital C

50
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:45,310
colon back / min Zhu W backslash in
semicolon do not touch anything else

51
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:55,590
there is no need for you to do so and
needed you don't see that that is what

52
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,690
you need to do where these very small
letters are written so at the beginning

53
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:06,039
you need to insert this line as you can
see I haven't heard it I have copied

54
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,639
this to note that said you can all see
it here it's probably too small for you

55
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,720
to see but doesn't matter I have showed
you the whole text in Notepad have shown

56
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,970
you what you need to do once you have
done that

57
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,790
click on OK

58
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:29,590
ok gettin and you will have the option
to apply it here since you actually done

59
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:36,380
some changes ahead and click on it and
then click on OK again however our

60
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:43,660
journey does not end here now that we
have done all of this we are finally

61
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:51,620
finally ready to open up clips let's go
ahead and click on OK here now it is a

62
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,690
starting it goes it

63
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:10,160
6056 5060 CPU usage is used 70% believe
that I was signed Li Xin just speed

64
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,700
things along

65
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:21,460
rate so there it is it's running its see
running under Java says it's not

66
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:28,220
responding with says oh well I'm not
responding but it actually is so just

67
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:35,470
let it run is it maxes out CPU until it
starts and actually it should drop it is

68
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:41,080
resource intensive and still it is 5030
and I was dropping because we're not

69
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,740
doing anything in it so I have the small
program here which is a default one but

70
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,080
let's go ahead and delete this project I
will go ahead and this project you won't

71
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,700
have it so delete

72
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:05,790
and if you get greeted we do welcome
screen he can just close it is see here

73
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,400
it's as Project Explorer and then you
have this close button

74
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,190
well if you click Close you're going to
close it if you get greeted with a

75
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,600
welcome screen where it wants to show
you things around so on and so forth

76
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,550
go ahead and click on this text and
closed till it don't be nice now let's

77
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:37,620
go ahead and click on File in the upper
left corner select new C++ project cuz

78
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:45,880
we want to create a C++ project by the
way before we continue just let me tell

79
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,070
you that there are numerous other idea
environments eclipse is very popular you

80
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:56,040
also have NetBeans which is extremely
popular as well and you have code blocks

81
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:02,350
a little bit less popular as it somewhat
limited in features and you also have

82
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:10,520
the Visual Studio Microsoft Visual
Studio 2008 I do believe it's free so

83
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:19,880
how do you like or you can actually well
the 2012 you have to buy its greats has

84
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,090
a lot of features but believe me there's
no need for you to do that eighty

85
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,050
percent of those features you will not
eclipse is just fine

86
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,430
can pretty much do whatever you want
with it so let's go ahead and named our

87
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:45,030
project how shall we name our project
well let's name it he maybe not yet hold

88
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:53,430
it down to just create one particular
project which I going to use and then we

89
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,800
will alter it in play around with it and
so on and so forth

90
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,750
let's go ahead and tape in key

91
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:08,900
we're not gonna start coding the
keylogger just yet I just name the

92
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,980
project you longer or I could have a
good have named it mary jane whatever I

93
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,840
want to do it could have been aimed at
by some of the things I see a light

94
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:27,040
table coffee cup of coffee or the really
old coffee that behind the screen may

95
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,190
need to remove one of these days anyway
let's go ahead you can select an empty

96
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,930
project if you like but for the time
being I just like to say hello world C++

97
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:44,420
project so let's go ahead and and here
you will be able to select a compiler we

98
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:50,330
have installed min Zhu W GCC can go
ahead and click on Next if you wish

99
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,500
there's no but you can also click on
Finish and be done with it I'm still ago

100
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,040
heading through this one so I can show
it to you

101
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,580
case to the author of the copyright
notice is a world treating you type in

102
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,880
here whatever you want

103
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,660
pretty sure that you'll know what these
options mean they're pretty self

104
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:17,350
explanatory click on Next and now you
have Debug and Release so what sort of

105
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,540
configuration would you like to have
when you compile it is it for release

106
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:28,490
release means that you are ready to
deploy it and it's pretty much the final

107
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,560
version of the product while the final
version but it's it's the version that

108
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,400
you're going to use any real system
outside of urine test environment and

109
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,990
debug is basically just what we will be
using now mainly because we were still

110
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,120
in the process of creation using the
debug basically the the word tells you

111
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,830
what it is it's the bugging so it's
finding these these problems the code

112
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,820
you are doing all of that the idea is
hoping you well once all of that is done

113
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,870
go to the release for him and you pilot
so let's go ahead in like

114
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:21,440
finish all done fine and dandy now we
need to go ahead and set some right here

115
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:37,540
so going to file and then going to
properties C++ bill go down where it's

116
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:51,130
setting said he believed was this one
resource that's why I like having the

117
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,529
stupid file because I don't forget these
things

118
00:11:54,529 --> 00:12:01,950
path and file properties ok so where is
it

119
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:08,210
symbols could it be that is this year
I'm pretty sure I'm using the wrong run

120
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:18,500
preprocessor include paths have to be
here you absolutely have to be here and

121
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:33,270
be a serious man by pattern

122
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:39,640
properties let's see here we go

123
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:48,460
so small correction here my bad I went
on to file you need to go on to your

124
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,680
project name here at ski lockers right
click on it

125
00:12:52,680 --> 00:13:02,950
a sincerely apologize for this just what
to do and go down into properties all of

126
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:10,570
this will be closed so we will have seen
/ C++ will go ahead and expand that go

127
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:26,380
into environment here so there we go so
click on it and once again we will have

128
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:35,390
the same thing here let's go ahead and
call PETA into pat so this is the file

129
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:42,240
that we have here its large it's tedious
and cumbersome go ahead and read through

130
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:52,830
it if you wish but this is the portion
that we need and please feel free to

131
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,440
copy it into this file for me it's here
in the center I do believe it's been

132
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:06,110
shaken up but you can feel free to get
pretty much the same position as I have

133
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:13,350
just after after just a tad here all you
need to do is they've been capital C

134
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:20,980
colon backslash GEW backslash been
remember to have a colon at the end if

135
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,620
you're putting it at the beginning if
you're putting it in the end of the

136
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,820
semicolon at D at the beginning so that
or if you're putting it indeed

137
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:39,920
if you're sorry for putting it in the
beginning so like this I don't think

138
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,350
it's gonna make a difference sometimes
it tends to cause some problems begin at

139
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,450
the beginning but no big deal they're
just put it in like this and you will

140
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,980
save yourself a lot of problems for me
it's here doesn't matter if it doesn't

141
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,500
work out for you in the beginning try
putting it in the same position as I

142
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,840
have but I was talking about these
semicolons if you put it here in the

143
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,110
beginning you need is some like gold at
the end the separated from the rest but

144
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:12,780
if you put it in the end like this you
need a semi cool in the beginning and

145
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:19,500
you do not need a semicolon and just
keep that in mind do not save it so

146
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,250
that's all we need to do with this with
the spat variable and then click on k

147
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:33,510
see because it's very small size in
notepad but you just go ahead and see

148
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,490
what you can do with error I don't know
go really really really close to the

149
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,150
screen and try to do it on your own
computers I do not know why they made it

150
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,070
so small it can be annoying as hell but
what can you do about it

151
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:54,120
go ahead and click on once you are done
with that ok so we need to do one more

152
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,460
thing what was it

153
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:06,620
binary Fraser ok so it is this one
should be

154
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:20,930
no no no no no man this is embarrassing
beyond belief is preferred start as you

155
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,230
can see it happens to the best of us I
swear I will not edit the subtle just

156
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:31,500
leave it i dont no way I hope that it
will make somebody laugh and if you're

157
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,550
super quick to follow through the
tutorials and click on things ourselves

158
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:40,860
if you make the same mistake I will die
laughing on the other side no big deal

159
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,390
you won't lose anything

160
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,390
the settings will be saved as you can
see just brings you back to the same

161
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:51,390
thing and all loss has occurred but as
you can see stupid things happen to

162
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,330
everybody

163
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,730
happen to everybody so don't worry about
it no big deal there let's see this one

164
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:13,700
should be in file properties property
file properties thank you Bill settings

165
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:21,040
there we go so go into C++ build and
then go into settings and then go into

166
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:31,580
binary raises make sure that the P E
windows Fraser is so like this just

167
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:38,610
click on OK the trip I do not believe
that there is anything else that we need

168
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:44,440
to do there is a hammer for building in
the upper left close to the upper left

169
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,270
corner you need to build everything
before you can actually run it so go

170
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,880
ahead and click on the hammer away then
click on the hammer

171
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,160
you can of course but the corruption is
control the building everything so

172
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:09,010
control the is built and it says here
bill out with what it has done

173
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:20,740
internal builder is used to build and
that it is using the ok so no problems

174
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,310
there you don't actually you don't
really care about this part this is

175
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:31,840
something you sort of commands are
things that you would use in the next to

176
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,280
make sure that I D problem or that you
don't have any problems with the idea

177
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,670
you can also compel these things but
that's irrelevant for the time being

178
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:47,600
let's go ahead and click on run so there
was this really a green play button that

179
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:58,770
I'm selecting now if I click on it if
this happens to you just rebuild that

180
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:09,240
what you go so you just click on the
green one if you get an error message

181
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,330
like I did just rebuild it for the
control of you couple of times that

182
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:19,060
should be fine this is our first program
it says hello world that's for the

183
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,440
program is supposed to do I will start
explaining this and how it all works out

184
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,030
in the fall tutorial until then I'm all
farewell
