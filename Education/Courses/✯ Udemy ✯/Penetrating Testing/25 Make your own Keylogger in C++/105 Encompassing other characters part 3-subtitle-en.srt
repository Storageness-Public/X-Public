1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,800
Welcome all to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,000
Today we're gonna do a bit of phrasing in our filters.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,100
So we want to add these spaces and new lines

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,000
so it doesn't all look like one gigantic line.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,200
We want it to be very neat, nice

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,500
so when the user goes into a new line

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,000
that the keylogger also goes into the line

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,300
when they're deleting something

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,200
that you know they have pressed the backspace.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,300
Although backspace, perhaps, is not as useful

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,700
and you know, when they press the space

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,350
we want to have a space

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,350
and that needs to look very nice and neat.

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,400
We don't want it to look sloppy

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,800
primarily because, you know when you go and when you start reading through it

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,300
it can be a nightmare

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,620
when you don't have proper...

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,250
it's probably not called phrasing, it's just sorting.

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's put it like that, shall we?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So what we need to do is just keep on adding case statements

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,379
but this time we're going to use virtual keys

22
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:04,200
So this is the list of virtual keys that I have intended to put in here today.

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,229
So you can put a lot of other ones...

24
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,200
There are a lot of them.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,409
You can put ones for the Num Lock.

26
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:16,500
You can put ones for the F keys.

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,670
I should put the ESC one here.

28
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,300
We can do that at the end of the tutorial

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,200
if I remember find it on the net as well

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,939
but in any case, it's not a bad idea to have them.

31
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,800
There are a few mandatory ones

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,170
without which, the reading through the log files will be impossible.

33
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,000
You can also put the arrow keys

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,500
I didn't put them in here, primarily because I don't see the point

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,200
but you can if you want.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,720
It's up to you completely.

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,900
So, let's type in "case"

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,670
and instead of a number, we're going to use a virtual key.

39
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,000
So "VK_SPACE"

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,700
I'm just gonna put a colon in at the end

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,590
and after that, all we need to do is type in...

42
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,000
We don't really need the brackets

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the curly brackets

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,900
We can just type in "write"

45
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,500
We don't need to check anything for shifts, or anything what kind.

46
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,400
I would just like you to write a space into the file

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
and that is literally it.

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,700
Afterwards, of course, "break"

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:34,500
because I don't want you to go any further.

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Next up. we're gonna type in "case VK"

51
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,800
Which one should we use now? Let's use the return

52
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,400
That's the ENTER

53
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,500
So we need a new line

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,000
"RETURN"

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,500
and we're gonna type in a colon there

56
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,000
So just "write"

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,300
What shall we write out?

58
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,800
So this will be a new line character

59
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Like this

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,200
Okay, so again "break"

61
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,400
and do we really need the backspace?

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,500
Oh wait, we need Tab. We definitely need Tab.

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,530
"break"

64
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,700
Oops, not break.

65
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,000
"case"

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,500
and we shall write "VK_TAB:"

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't really like that much to code and talk at the same time.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
It's not a good idea at all.

69
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,400
Perhaps it is better when I show you the code after I've written it

70
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,000
but we'll alternate and we'll see how it goes.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,600
So case Tab

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,000
and for this we will write

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
quite literally just press a Tab

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and that's it

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,650
and we can also put one for backspace

76
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:05,620
I mean, no big deal right?

77
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,800
case

78
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,000
At the end we can put a default case as before

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,560
but we'll see how will that work out

80
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,359
and will we actually put it.

81
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:22,500
If we do put it, our key logger is going to have broader range of what it grabs

82
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,930
but keep in mind

83
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,800
that there is only so much that you need to grab with a key logger.

84
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
A lot of key loggers out there send you a lot of information

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,800
and they grab a lot of keystrokes

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,349
which are of little to no use to you.

87
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:41,600
So what we're trying to do is narrow it down to only those segments

88
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,020
which are useful to us

89
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,800
and which are likely to be used.

90
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,400
Anyway, let's go ahead and put the backspace.

91
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,000
So "VK_BACK"

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and "write << "<BackSpace>"

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and we can put the separation spaces

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,500
beginning and the end.

95
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,430
I don't know if I'm going to write something else, but type in break here

96
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,000
in case I do

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,800
even though it doesn't really make much sense at the moment.

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,600
So now we have these statements here

99
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,000
and I'll show you how much prettier will our input look like

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Well, it won't look like anything if we have errors.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's see what the problem is

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,600
Well, a semi-colon would have been nice.

103
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,000
Is that the only thing?

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,200
No, unfortunately it's not.

105
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,910
What else is the problem?

106
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, okay okay

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So I forgot to place a colon there.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's working through now.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Okay, so good

110
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
No logic errors, just a typo

111
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,000
None that I can see anyway.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,010
So let's go ahead and delete this file

113
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,000
Save all

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,500
You can probably put in a few other keys we like, like delete or escape.

115
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:33,800
Okay so "username"

116
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,500
and you'll see what happens now.

117
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:46,000
"password blablablatralala"

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,800
Here we go

119
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,500
So "User", and then it says "<BackSpace> name tralala"

120
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,700
"Password blablablatralala"

121
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay, so let's ahead and make this a bit more interesting.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,200
Let's go ahead onto the net

123
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,800
virtual key codes

124
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,300
and let's find for DEL and ESC

125
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,760
because I'm not a magician.

126
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,500
This is pretty much what I do.

127
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,550
I browse the web and I look for the things that I need

128
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:29,000
When I encounter a problem, I don't just magically pull the solution out of my hat

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
so no worries there.

130
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,870
ESCAPE

131
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,370
There we go

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,600
We can also write these notations

133
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,500
but I prefer these

134
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,000
as it's a little bit clearer when you're reading through the code

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,500
to know what is it exactly that that line of command is doing.

136
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,800
So we're going to conduct a real-life test now as well

137
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,270
"case VK_ESCAPE :"

138
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,260
"write"

139
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,500
I don't feel like putting these spaces here.

140
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,800
It doesn't look pretty at all.

141
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
So let's go ahead and removed this

142
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,000
Type in "write <<"

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,200
and here we're gonna put...what should we put?

144
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,260
I don't know, " "<ESC>" "

145
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,300
I think that's going to be sufficient

146
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,000
and there is just another one would that I like to put in, which is DEL

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,990
I think it's VK_DEL, what else could it be?

148
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,860
but let's just be certain of that.

149
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,810
So "case"

150
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,700
and let's do this

151
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
CTRL F

152
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,500
Delete

153
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,700
Ah, It's VK_DELETE

154
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,400
There you go

155
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,000
Not always right

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
"case VK_DELETE"

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,350
and we can right now

158
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,900
"write <<"

159
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,530
What should we write here?

160
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:10,000
I think DEL will suffice

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's just use DELETE

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm awesome at this, aren't I?

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,800
At these sort of mistakes, but oh well

164
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,200
and because I don't know, I'm just gonna type in "break" here

165
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,300
because this list is going to probably keep on expanding

166
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,520
throughout the course

167
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,800
but that's really up to you.

168
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,329
You can request certain characters from me

169
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:44,200
and I can implement them here, so no big deal.

170
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:52,900
I want to encourage as much as possible for us to communicate

171
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,200
and you know, you can provide ideas

172
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,800
and I can show you how you can do it, etc.

173
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,020
That's my plan, anyway.

174
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,200
So, let's go ahead and stop this first

175
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
and let's conduct a live test.

176
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,700
So we're gonna go ahead and delete this whole file.

177
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,000
So we don't want anything in it.

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,870
Oh by the way, you can also delete the file.

179
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,100
The whole file

180
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,600
It's just going to get recreated the next time the program runs

181
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,800
so don't worry about it, if you have deleted it

182
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,500
or something of a kind.

183
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,200
So let's go ahead and begin the session

184
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,000
It is now

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,700
missing something somewhere

186
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,800
these things, as usual

187
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,200
Where am I missing it?

188
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay, 142

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Not a colon. I need a semi-colon k how about now

190
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,300
Okay, how about now?

191
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:55,000
Will the session be so kind as to run?

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,700
There we go

193
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,200
So it is running

194
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,000
Currently we have it set up running in eclipse

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,500
but later on, I will show you how you can actually hide it

196
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,700
even how you can hide this executable file somewhere on the system

197
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,870
and how you can hide from the user as well.

198
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,700
So we will cover that, don't worry

199
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,200
but for the time being, this is just a test run

200
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,350
So let's open up Firefox or whatever browser you want.

201
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,899
It won't make a big difference.

202
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,400
We can use any website that we want, really.

203
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Here we can actually use Udemy.

204
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,879
This is going to work

205
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,839
regardless whether the site is HTTPS or HTTP

206
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,500
Whether...whatever, it's completely irrelevant.

207
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,670
I'm just using the site as an example.

208
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,800
So I would like to log into my account.

209
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm not gonna obviously log into my own account.

210
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Anytime now

211
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,000
Either the net is really slow or the virtual machine is really slow

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,200
Ugh, these days I really need a new computer.

213
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,400
If this crashes, I'm going to...I don't know

214
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,000
Come on! Please!

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,500
It is enabled

216
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,670
Anytime now

217
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,300
No, okay

218
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,800
So let's just use some other site

219
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,990
I don't know

220
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,200
Gmail here, whatever

221
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,000
Could you just please open the site?

222
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,500
I don't know, for some strange reason it didn't want to open.

223
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,100
If I click on "Sign in", I can enter the email.

224
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:57,000
So "pleaseMakesureYouhaveApermissiontodothis"

225
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,029
This is going to be our username.

226
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,500
Quite a complex is user name.

227
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,000
Really stupid of me.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It says "Sorry, Google doesn't recognize this email"

229
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
Well, I'm just an abundance of failures today.

230
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,000
Any place where I can actually type in a user name and a password.

231
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,500
Let's go to Ubuntu forums

232
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,000
and try to do it there

233
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,800
I'm just an abundance of fantastic examples today.

234
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,000
Ugh...Come on, my friend, come on

235
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,770
Okay, so this is not important.

236
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,800
Ugh...Of course

237
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,100
All of this is being logged

238
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:49,000
and you will see when we open up the log file

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,310
and there we go.

240
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,900
So finally a place where we can...

241
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,100
"heythere"

242
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,000
or even better, so "user"

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Even better -- "USERNAME"

244
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
God, why are you doing this to me now?

245
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Password

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,300
Excellent!

247
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,200
So USERNAME, password

248
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,680
You can feel free to close it

249
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,300
and I probably need to update Firefox, or something of a kind.

250
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,770
I need to clean this computer up

251
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,000
bring it into shape and working order.

252
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This virtual machine, that is

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,580
and now we can go ahead and open up our file

254
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,800
and wow, we have a lot of things.

255
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,840
So it says "Udemy"

256
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,000
We've typed in Udemy, and then we typed in Gmail

257
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and this is what we typed in for Gmail

258
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,500
as a user name

259
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,100
and then there's like "heythere<backspace>< backspace>"

260
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,210
leaking something quite a lot

261
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,500
and there we go.

262
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:08,000
So it says "USERNAMEPASSWORDPASSWORD"

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,080
So, because we're on the net

264
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,920
we've been doing a lot of things back and forth, back and forth

265
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,710
and some of the things got logged in the way that they did

266
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,610
because this is the realistic one

267
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,100
but these logs will improve over time

268
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,600
as we add a few more filters.

269
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,000
Feel free to try it at home.

270
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,200
Don't go about stealing passwords, or something of a kind.

271
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,400
Installing it in the machines that you don't have the permission to

272
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,600
but rather instead, install it on your own machine

273
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,400
and run a test run

274
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,300
and you will see, it will record the user name and password when you type it in.

275
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,000
It will record everything else as well

276
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,500
but hey, that's just an extra benefit or a burden

277
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,200
because you have to sit through the log file.

278
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,790
These log files can be like 50 pages long

279
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,700
because sometimes key loggers tend to run the system for days on end

280
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,500
and then the mail gets sent.

281
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,800
So you have to sit through and to find what you're looking for.

282
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,700
Anyway, I bid you all farewell

283
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,000
and I hope to see you in the follow-up tutorial.
