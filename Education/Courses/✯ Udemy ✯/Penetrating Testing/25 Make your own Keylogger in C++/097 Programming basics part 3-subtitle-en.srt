1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So let's just get into it right away.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Just go ahead and switch these around.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
So it's "less than" and then "equal to"

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sorry, I think I committed error there in the last tutorial.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Doesn't really matter. Just switch it around.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,500
We still didn't run the code

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,200
and I have also added, prior to the beginning of this tutorial

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,000
"i" at the end of each one of these lines, just for the sake of demonstration purposes

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,400
so that you can see that "i", with each pass, will increase.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,840
So let us conduct a first pass and see what happens

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, let's go ahead and compile

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,860
It says nothing to do because I haven't really haven't done anything.

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,500
11

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,800
It should be "A is greater than B" now.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,800
A is greater than B, and i is zero.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,660
So you can see that it's here, it's getting printed out, and it's zero.

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:10,020
so let's go ahead and continue to loop
at state being in four and then type in

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,780
10 should bibi is rated M for ya

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:23,220
is less than be there so rude but these
pages then it says here one so it has

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:30,509
increased by one and if I just keep on
doing this to allow its 3 end once it

22
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:38,229
reaches 3 it says game over it can't go
it can't go any further than that

23
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:43,579
because we just stated it can to go the
loop cannot repeat itself one more time

24
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:48,950
because then it would be greater because
then it would be greater than three and

25
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,979
it becomes greater than three this
evaluates to false and this entire loop

26
00:01:53,979 --> 00:02:02,270
gets terminated as it exits the loop and
it's just rinse out game over

27
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:11,830
anyway that would be D while loop which
you can use we also have a for loop so

28
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:25,269
let's go ahead and actually lets you use
most of the code here and we need to

29
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:30,239
delete the last curly bracket and we're
not gonna have the eye plus plus here

30
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,380
let's go ahead and delete that as well
and we won't need the creation site here

31
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:46,860
I know what's going to deport AP in for
open open parenthesis in equal now you

32
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,220
can do this without any problems

33
00:02:48,220 --> 00:03:07,710
equals 0 semicolon is less than three

34
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:16,170
bottom ok here we go this will do
exactly the same thing even the compiler

35
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,290
it's pretty much the same thing there
was no different machine doesn't

36
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,890
differentiate I don't think it
differentiates at all there might be

37
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:29,200
some slight differences between for a
while but I do believe that many that I

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,940
have read many statements that they're
pretty much the same as far as the

39
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,860
machine is concerned for a while so
we're just using them to create

40
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:43,540
repetitive action something or
continuous action of something anyway

41
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:53,630
let's go ahead and go ahead and run this
see what happens

42
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,030
changes

43
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:08,660
so it does run again the eye is it
rating as you can see and it reaches to

44
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,760
because we didn't state that it is equal
to not within the stated that's equal we

45
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,940
just said ok I needs to be less than
three and that is quite literally all

46
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,780
while I'm here on the subject

47
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:30,990
go ahead and introduce one more value so
another value would be float variable

48
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,990
type sorry has introduced senator
variable day load that would be in BC D

49
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,120
E

50
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,820
that be equal to zero point something so
if you want you can put it in like this

51
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:53,590
then them win three or zero points so
this is just a great zero point that

52
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,320
sounded terrible type anyway if you are
uncertain as to which variable to use if

53
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,580
numbers are concerned just use double
you can't actually in terms of numbers

54
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:12,150
you can't actually go wrong with double
next up what I would like to do is just

55
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,380
go ahead and show you a little bit of
the mathematical operations that happen

56
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:36,270
so let's delete this ok so let's go
ahead and demonstrate an idea

57
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:46,540
exxon so we have three variable types so
let's let's play around and just give

58
00:05:46,540 --> 00:06:14,540
them five and this is going to be so if
I don't see out if I did I B B equals

59
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:28,290
sorry be easy to do and a is equal to
five and if I do this I see a device a

60
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:35,180
divided by the way I would like you to
take a wild guess what the result will

61
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,790
be remembered into juice can only be
whole numbers and we are dividing one

62
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:48,230
introduced by a mother integers so let's
see what what the result will be let's

63
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:55,100
go ahead and press it

64
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:19,510
yes I did but we need we need this
petition ok so is 5/8 be which is to the

65
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:27,640
result is to now as far as I know 5/2 is
not equal to two but you know that's

66
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,220
just me

67
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:35,320
could be wrong and the whole mass of
this world could be wrong as well let's

68
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,520
just assume that it's not let's assume
that the mathematics of this world is

69
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,410
correct

70
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:48,230
5/2 is not to why why does this happen

71
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:57,360
well everything if you if you divide one
in by a another in and if you get a

72
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,630
result something like then . blah blah
blah the blah blah blah part will be

73
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,540
gone it will get truncated it will be
like it didnt never existence of the

74
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,200
result is then put in something then
will remain everything behind it will go

75
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,150
away I'm just using these numbers for
reference sake it could be any other

76
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:27,510
number could be whatever whatever so
this could be a result of integer

77
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:34,650
division and this whole number could be
the result of integer division but you

78
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,849
will get this as a result and nothing
else if you divide two in two years and

79
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:50,120
the other hand if we were to divide see
by the so the lead this part I really

80
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,190
feel a crew rating it all the time and
sure the student appreciated I do you

81
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:03,620
can see clearly what is going on it's
double so see divided by Andy

82
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,180
template 3/16 2.34

83
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:15,840
or by the way when I see you don't
appreciate it I mean like you just find

84
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,650
it boring today keep on retyping the
same things over and over again that's

85
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:28,280
what I meant by that anyway you get a
result 0.17% you will get the small

86
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,260
points here if you divide to double
numbers also if you divide float numbers

87
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:42,450
as well so please be very careful with
that was a lot of mistakes can happen

88
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:48,320
with this and you should be aware these
things also by this point of time if you

89
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,070
haven't noticed each line of code has
its own designated number indeed era

90
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,720
section in the console down below where
the output is given if there are any

91
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,260
errors it will report the line where the
area has

92
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,800
you will get you will get a report weird
error has occurred occurred on which

93
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,900
line because it's fairly simple now but
imagine if you had 300 400 lines that

94
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:18,500
the nightmare have reduced the font size
but aside from that just take a look at

95
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,370
some other functionalities of the
console which we're going to need to

96
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:45,040
follow tutorials safe I just a pin ups
please

97
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:59,899
we use can I lead and I don't know these
exclamation marks this is gonna run

98
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:07,680
forever basically this program will
never stop until we terminated so how do

99
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,180
you deal with something like this right

100
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:31,040
summit oh well then they have to press
it in time basically it's the let's

101
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,389
think of a better example of this is a
really good way to crash a virtual

102
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:42,029
machine just overloaded like this I was
think of a better example it's just type

103
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:48,110
something in that will not be harmful in
any way caused the split maxi it will

104
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,870
just keep on printing the same word over
and over again as fast as it possibly

105
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,449
can

106
00:11:53,449 --> 00:12:05,600
which is not a good thing at all so
let's go ahead and open sea in basically

107
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,519
this program will not consume CPU much
the CPU or anything it will just wait

108
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,019
for user to improve something but it
will continue to run anyway on the right

109
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:23,190
side you have a discriminate but so you
can go ahead and click it but you can

110
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:30,000
also you also have the clear console so
far this if I press STOP to see this

111
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,750
till the program is not running but this
still remains and they could just the

112
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,880
console and it's gone forever

113
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,399
no more players a console is nice neat
and clean basically the equivalent of a

114
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:53,100
clear command in Linux anyway I like to
be you all farewell here

115
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,550
and we will see each other in a
follow-up story will continue on the

116
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:04,540
basics they will be a few more of these
tutorials and then we will actually jump

117
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:10,800
into the loggers source code don't worry
if you don't catch everything don't

118
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:18,080
worry if you don't understand everything
straight away it's ok no big deal just

119
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,540
ask in the discussions I'll be happy to
help you out I'll be happy to explain

120
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:29,080
anything that remains unclear but I'm
just saying don't be like I didn't

121
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,660
figure it out without all known not this
is well just one word what am I gonna do

122
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,260
about it

123
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:42,400
addict not good so just asking to
discussions and I will help you out no

124
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:49,060
worries there again you don't need to
understand all of it immediately you

125
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,580
will as we progress through the course a
lot of things will repeat themselves in

126
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,500
one form or another

127
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,930
anyway farewell and I'll see you in
default story
