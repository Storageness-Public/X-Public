1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Welcome all

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,200
Anyway, we're gonna go ahead and do a release version

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,200
So we're gonna create a real version

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,300
Well, not a real version

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,000
We'll just create the one that we would normally use.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,200
Something that we can use in a CD or in a USB

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,650
or something that we can send, etc

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,500
and then we will see one obvious problem with it

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,800
which you cannot see when you are doing this in eclipse.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,649
It's a pretty significant problem.

12
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:39,500
There are a lot of workarounds.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,000
The simplest workaround is simply to hide what is being shown

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,800
but perhaps not best one.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,000
However, let's go ahead and take a look at how this example will work out.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,200
So we have our program here

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,500
We will go on to the hammer in the upper left corner.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,800
Go ahead and just select it.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,800
It will be selected debug by default...

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,900
You will have debug selected

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,400
Go ahead and select release

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,800
and then go ahead and build it.

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,700
Okay, for me, it says "Nothing to build..."

24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,700
but if I CTRL S save and if I do build, it has finished building it.

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,800
So what does it say?

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,200
Permission denied

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,600
Okay, so I have a keylogger running.

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,100
I almost always do these days

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,700
because I'm running a lot of test runs and testing out the code

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,000
in order to make sure that it is right for you guys.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,500
Anyway, let's go ahead and attempt this one more time.

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,600
So, Release

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,300
Building

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,930
There you go

35
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,000
It finished without any problems.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,500
Now we're gonna go ahead and minimize this.

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't need this

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,500
I don't need this either

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,000
and let's go ahead and open up our file manager

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,430
and go into our workspace.

41
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,400
So it says here "Keylogger"

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,799
That's the name of our project.

43
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm just go ahead and click on it

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,200
and you have a debug version

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,700
and you have the release version.

46
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,230
So we're gonna do release

47
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,000
and I already have tested it out

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,200
so I'm just gonna go ahead and delete this file

49
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,000
and I will go ahead and double click on this keylogger.exe file

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,200
and this window is a problem

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,580
because, you know

52
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,600
it's gonna sit here

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,000
and I assure you it's recording information.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,920
Here we can do a test run.

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,100
I can open up another notepad

56
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:53,000
and I can type in "Feel free to make suggestions I will welcome them"

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There you go

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can open up this file.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,200
and you see "Feel free to make suggestions I will welcome thime"

60
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,400
but you see, when I made a mistake here

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,900
when I used backspaces

62
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,500
this is how it looks like.

63
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,200
So perhaps we didn't need to include a backspace

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,540
but then, it would just say T H I M E

65
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,200
and then E M at the end.

66
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,800
It would be a a little bit difficult to figure out what was the attempt.

67
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,200
What was supposed to be written there.

68
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Anyway, in order to rectify this window

69
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,900
that is quite problematic here

70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,790
and especially if it runs at boot time

71
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,000
you get stuck with a window like this

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,700
what do you think a normal user will do

73
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,829
Well, I can guarantee you that they're not going to get suspicious.

74
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,500
Most people don't care.

75
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,160
I, myself

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,600
if I was tired that day after a long day of work

77
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,500
or something of a kind

78
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,700
I would just click on X, close it

79
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,000
and there you go.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,500
The keylogger program is no longer running.

81
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:08,300
It is recording nothing here.

82
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:18,000
AM I RECORDING?

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,100
Of course not

84
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,600
So there is nothing

85
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
because the program itself is not running.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,700
So as you imagine, this can be problematic.

87
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,670
I mean, yeah

88
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,020
all your effort down the drain for no good reason.

89
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,100
That is why we're going to create a function to hide this window.

90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,300
We are going to name this function simply "hide"

91
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,500
I can think of no a better name for it

92
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,950
and we're going to create a function prototype up here

93
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,100
and down below, I have the code listed out

94
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,600
because I really didn't want to write this during the tutorial

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,000
as I would make mistakes for sure

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and I will explain this in a moment.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So let's just go ahead and type in "void hide"

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and there we go.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Fantastic

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,560
So we're going to call this function within our main function

101
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,690
or we could even call it within this function.

102
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,500
We will see what we shall do

103
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
but let me go ahead and explain what we're doing.

104
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,700
So we're creating a handler called "stealth"

105
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,500
and you see it says "stealth=FindwindowA("ConsoleWindowClass"..."

106
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,160
and then "ShowWindow". it says "stealth"

107
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
and this is the handler

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,770
and then it says whether to show it or not.

109
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,740
It's 0, so don't show it.

110
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,500
It's not a good idea.

111
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,270
Let's go ahead and copy it.

112
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,500
We can just put it here.

113
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,000
No big deal

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,400
and now we can pack a release version.

115
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,650
Save it first

116
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,000
There you go

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and if we delete this file once more

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Run it

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There we go

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,400
Okay, so apparently nothing happens

121
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,500
because I didn't do this the right way

122
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,700
or something of a kind.

123
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,200
Let's have a look

124
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,800
avoid, hide...

125
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,550
Of course it won't work

126
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,900
Of course

127
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,760
I'm a genius

128
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,700
I am a genius

129
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,700
You know there is nobody smarter than me in this world

130
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,000
Seriously

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,200
So let's go ahead and save it

132
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,500
and let's build it

133
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,800
and after that, we can open up our file manager

134
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,410
delete this file again

135
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,900
and start up the keylogger.exe

136
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,500
and you see, this appears.

137
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,300
We cannot see it.

138
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,500
You could see it in the processes.

139
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,790
There are ways of removing it from the processes as well

140
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,900
but that's kinda difficult

141
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,700
considering that you raise the suspicion levels with antivirus systems

142
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,000
and stuff of a kind.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,300
So we'll see what we can do to bypass the antiviruses.

144
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,000
Although, this what we have with it now

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
there is a chance that it would get classified as something malicious as well.

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,700
We will later on see how to avoid antivirus detection

147
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,500
but you see, by creating a simple handler

148
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,500
and by calling the built-in Windows functions in C++

149
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,900
we are able...

150
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,200
well, they're basically using the functions from the Windows API

151
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,400
we are able to hide the to the window

152
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,500
and not display it at all.

153
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,560
This program is running, as you can see it here

154
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,770
and that's not really a good way to check it.

155
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,300
The best way to check it is simply to verify the functionality of the program.

156
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:20,000
So let's go ahead and write something

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:36,780
"i like to well i do not really know no sense"

158
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,600
Wow, this sentence is messy.

159
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Okay, so "i like..."

160
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,100
I pressed the backspace because I'd leave something, I suppose

161
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,700
"to well i do not really know no sense"

162
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,500
and you can see that this recording

163
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,700
and you cannot see it unless you open a task manager and have a look there.

164
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,960
As I said, there are ways from even hiding it in the task manager as well

165
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,500
but that's really advanced stuff.

166
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,360
So we might get into that as well.

167
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,100
It's all really up to you

168
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,400
and how much of a demand for a course there is

169
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,800
and how much do you want the new videos to come.

170
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,200
As I said, please do not hesitate to submit as many suggestions as you like

171
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,400
and to ask as many questions as you like.

172
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:36,000
Of course, I cannot guarantee that I will adhere to every the single suggestion

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,200
but I definitely will.

174
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,040
I usually just take them, I copy/paste them into a file

175
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,800
and then, when I want to decide what to make

176
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,000
I take a look at them and I say

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,400
"Okay we're going to do this, this we can't, etc"

178
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,300
So as long as you guys want me to bring you new videos, I will.

179
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,200
So no worries there.

180
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,580
Also, take a look at the date when this video was published

181
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,700
and during this month

182
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,100
there's gonna be a lot more videos to come, I assure you.

183
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,960
Anyway, I bid you farewell

184
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,900
and I hope that you have enjoyed this segment

185
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,000
of the keylogger chapter.
