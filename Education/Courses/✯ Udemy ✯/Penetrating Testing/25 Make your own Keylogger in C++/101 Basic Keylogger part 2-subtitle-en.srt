00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Welcome back all

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,200
Today I'm gonna go ahead and play around with different cases

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,300
and we will also place this in a function, in order to clean the main function a little bit.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,000
So what do I mean by play around with cases?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Well, this keylogger is very far from being perfect.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,060
It can definitely be a little bit useful

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,500
but it's useless until it can actually send some information somewhere

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
and I have it running, so let's stop it.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,800
Anyway, it's not very useful now.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
Not because it can't send information

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,900
I will deal with that separately

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,800
but rather instead because of the way in which it records information.

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,200
If you press tabs or space or something of a kind

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,989
it doesn't really record it that well in the file

15
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:54,900
and that we've seen in the previous tutorials.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,200
So we need to deal with that.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,970
We will deal with it with a switch statement

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,950
before we actually do that let's just go
ahead and put credit all of this into a

19
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,740
single function make things a little bit
easier for us this function will be void

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,540
it will return it nothing I will call it
log and it will receive no arguments of

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:29,659
what it will require no arguments of
whatsoever I have written the type of

22
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:41,930
their so down here all day to function
of copy disk but let's just cut it will

23
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:48,900
be easier there we go

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:58,480
and I we need to do is type in log here
hold a function in Maine that's it so

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:09,890
this will work you can test it out in
control of 11 and things out

26
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:26,740
ok let's go ahead and check the file out
thing this is the same lower or upper ok

27
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,240
we got some nuances to see this is a
this this is a big problem

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,180
the big problem the saudis keys enter
shift something like that I'm sure it

29
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,230
makes no difference whatsoever because
we don't want them to be written and

30
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,330
written in this fashion want to be
written in a different fashion and you

31
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,870
see a DL it says does it work

32
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:58,410
interesting ok so let's close this and
delete this file so that it is so that

33
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:07,500
it is clean and how I stopped program no
I haven't stopped program excellent so

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:22,640
just see if they're ago so now the
school through different cases could

35
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,700
make a separate function here we could
actually stick around

36
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:35,239
try to rate in here well that is already
here there's no need to actually ready

37
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:41,130
separate function for this now the first
thing that we're going to do is delete

38
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:48,310
right see we will rewrite it later on as
a default gay so in case none of the

39
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:55,340
above that will get executed for switch
just each tape in which

40
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:04,129
open prevent disease he is the condition
so we are going to pass the characters

41
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:10,970
see to switch and then based upon what
that character C is switch will do

42
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:21,419
something so let's go ahead and type in
case one case one actually known as case

43
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:32,900
one case eight so if she has a numerical
value of aid see character has a

44
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,450
numerical value of fate in ASCII that
spans the backspace so here it is

45
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:48,840
says back space ok no problems let's
just do it here and they played colon

46
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,979
not a semicolon here

47
00:04:50,979 --> 00:05:00,410
space and then we're going to use right
from here

48
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,639
output and we are simply going to
substitute

49
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,360
we're not being told to see to it rather
instead in case she is eight we're going

50
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,690
to output something else and Casey has
an American value of it so what should

51
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,229
we go out but I like to do it like this
with the lesser than sign and then type

52
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:33,800
in case this is just how I like the
substitute backspace

53
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:43,099
mean if you don't feel free to like it
any way you like completely up to you so

54
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:47,729
let's go ahead and type in Michael and
here and that's it

55
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:57,889
now we need to jump into the case so
case and then we will find something I'm

56
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:58,520
sure it is

57
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,970
have plenty of these cases you can play
around with them as much as you like as

58
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:10,050
much as you wish so let's see what else
are we going to substitute so we have a

59
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:25,580
live feed vertical feed data which can
also have fun with skip we can also

60
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:38,830
substitute escape which is 27 and delete
which is one hundred and twenty-seven 27

61
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:48,240
so what was that

62
00:06:48,240 --> 00:07:09,580
see you believe that this will be
sufficient and 127 right so we place

63
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,199
here

64
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:22,840
27 del

65
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,940
so you get the general idea you just
keep on writing delete this for every

66
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:38,080
case that you wish to that you wish to
modify what I would suggest is let's go

67
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,169
ahead and find a switch is 32 so those
are some of the things that you should

68
00:07:44,169 --> 00:08:00,350
change so case 32 right so obviously you
could write space in I don't know

69
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,570
doesn't seem very logical to me I just
like to say but in cyberspace quite

70
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,320
literally tens certain space and nothing
else but you could also type in

71
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,470
something here

72
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:19,510
rights and then have that outfit that's
also an option I just don't like doing

73
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:31,990
that and case for enter surer where the
where exactly it is I just go ahead and

74
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:49,860
take a look so separator and anybody see
enter here should be around here

75
00:08:49,860 --> 00:09:13,000
somewhere like this

76
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:30,900
okay so it's thirteen 13 hits a return
sorry of course so 30 case 13 I would

77
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:42,960
like you to right center maybe there
isn't a need for this but then I would

78
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,690
also like you to insert a new life so
that our entire record log file is not

79
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:56,540
all in one single I'd which can be a
talk quick to read and file can be

80
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:03,230
difficult to see review ok so we have
inserted some of them as let's just

81
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:15,030
creating default case in cases of the
above the fold right right see so this

82
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:22,510
will be the same as before you will just
see out let's go ahead press Ctrl F 11

83
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:30,930
yes

84
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:38,839
ok so it is running now let's go ahead
and open up our Console is so slightly

85
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:45,130
best baseless backspace key pressing it
and now we need to type in something and

86
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,020
actually its press Enter

87
00:10:49,020 --> 00:11:07,660
amplifying first then type in this new
text over a longer text and take a look

88
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:21,500
at backspace ask a lil editor backs
faces no problems there and to enter

89
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:40,120
this and then gave Dell case I pressed
enter have no idea let's just go ahead

90
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:55,060
and write a check the lead press
backspace and press enter once this is

91
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:03,959
the new president earning more times but
the if I have messed something up we

92
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,589
will fix it in the fall of Doral doesn't
really matter

93
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:15,550
mistakes are bound to happen here so
it's a school and opened the file

94
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:30,649
txt case have pressed enter way too many
times here what's the problem

95
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,649
13 it right

96
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:45,329
enter if it's 32

97
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:50,980
wartime see if we can actually figure it
out here if not all have the solution

98
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,879
for you to follow tutorial but I will
not edit my mistakes out I want to keep

99
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:04,079
them in here we have a lot of backs
basis one character is not getting

100
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,769
interpreted right not sure what that is
but it seems to be interpreting Space

101
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:17,519
Center probably messed up with DES key
values because you can see in between

102
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:28,170
every word is putting up so this is the
new text and I seem to have a problem

103
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,749
with my ASCII code I will check it out
on the website one more time and see how

104
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:37,290
it works out from there but that is
completely irrelevant as I will have the

105
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,449
solution for you to follow tutorial what
you want to be looking at is the switch

106
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:49,189
statement and how you can define
individual cases so individual cases

107
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:57,399
which are like have a tab you have a
controlled you have you have the windows

108
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:07,179
home but you have space and enter you
have shifted damage and shift also have

109
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:16,169
backspace and I del arrows and I do
believe the dead is it escaped as well

110
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:22,100
that is it so we gotta make quite a few
of these cases and once we have made

111
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,769
them all then we will have a proper file
one of the next steps would be to

112
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:32,689
differentiate between lowercase and
uppercase letters anyway but you'll

113
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:36,319
farewell and I hope to see you in
default of tutorial
