Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.
Today I am going to go ahead and just show

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,660
you that you can actually boot from this USB
stick. There is this is not a mandatory tutorial,

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,470
or anything like that. This is just to prove
that this is functional, and this method does

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,339
indeed work and that you can boot from the
USB state that we have created off Kali Linux

5
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:32,509
with encrypted persistent storage. I am going
to go ahead and plug it in. Then, I'm going

6
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:38,430
to go ahead and power on my laptop. I am using
a Dell laptop. For me, I need to press either

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:48,120
F2 or F12. I'm going to go ahead and press
F12 for start up options, since F2 is for

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,129
BIOS and F12 is for boot options on a Dell
machine. If you're using Acer or HP or something

9
00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:00,199
of a kind, it might be different. It will
always be shown on the screen which keys can

10
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,739
you press for which options at boot. You see,
I've encountered this problem that I want

11
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,320
to share with you as well. I get a screen
like this when I select boot options, and

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,280
I cannot select the options. Do not immediately
assume you've done something wrong, that your

13
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,740
USB is not functional or something like that.
Instead, what you can do is just power off

14
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:33,939
the machine. No big deal. Power it back on
and enter BIOS. So for me, it's F2. There

15
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:38,700
is nothing you need to do in BIOS for it right
at the moment. Of course, if you wish, you

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:50,740
can select the default boot option to be the
USB. There it is on at the moment. I will

17
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:58,090
go over to boot. And there's the legacy boot
and then press enter. I don't see USB here.

18
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:05,289
Okay that's fine. Just press escape several
times until it says exit disregarding changes.

19
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:13,630
click, Yes. Control/alt/del to restart the
machine again. Then you can press the boot

20
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:23,160
options. There we go, so I have boot options
now. See it says USB storage device. I'm going

21
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,190
to go ahead and select it. Now, I have boot
options for Kali linux. I have boot from a

22
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,310
USB. I'm gonna go ahead and select live USB
encrypted persistence because that is the

23
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:42,410
one that we have chosen to create. Hopefully
that will be suitable for you as well. Go

24
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:50,860
ahead and press enter. So it's rolling and
rolling. I have other encrypted

25
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,860
partitions on this laptop, so it will ask me
if I want to decrypt them as well. I will

26
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,970
say no.  You will not encounter this unless
you have other encrypted partitions. It's

27
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:08,180
asking me to unlock my drive. I do not
wish to unlock it so, I press 'N' for no. Just

28
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:15,910
enter some random key, then press enter. Do this
again for SDA3. I do not wish to decrypt this

29
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:22,240
just press 'n' or yes. 'N' is for no and 'Y'
is for yes. If you want to retry the decryption

30
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:39,170
process. I would like to decrypt SDB3 because
that is my USB. You need to be familiar with

31
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,810
the partitioning scheme on the machine to
know which which ones do you wish decrypt.

32
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,460
Take a look at the output of FDISK space â€“ L "fdisk -l"
as shown in the previous tutorials to figure

33
00:03:50,460 --> 00:04:01,400
out how your USB partition is. Is it DEV SDA,
or is it DEV SDB? It can be DEV SDC or something

34
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,840
depending on what it is. It's telling me now,
please unlock disc DEV SDB3. I'm going to

35
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,870
type in my decryption key and press enter.
Don't worry if you can't see anything while

36
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,590
you're typing. It's perfectly fine. That is
the way it is supposed to be so that somebody

37
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:30,930
from behind 
won't actually see the length of your key.
It's a security precaution, which I really

38
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,100
like in Linux. This is not the case in Windows
unfortunately, where the length of pretty

39
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:42,310
much anything you type and any passwords is
revealed. So I have my system. Now, my wireless

40
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,600
is working it says, "wireless networks available."
I'm not going to connect to any of them because

41
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,870
there is no point. The only thing that I'm
going to do now is create a file on my desktop

42
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,710
and then reboot the machine, so that you can
see that I do have persistent storage. Let's

43
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:09,600
go ahead and right-click on desktop to create
new folder. Name it whatever, then press enter.

44
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,090
You see this folder that I'm moving around
and is now sitting in the center of the desktop.

45
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:22,850
That is the folder which we have created.
Let me just by the open it and create a new

46
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:37,400
document which will be named something. If
I open up something and I will write in it.

47
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,740
I know that the image qualities for on this
cell phone so here's what I shall do. I will

48
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:53,340
do this. The only reason I'm doing this is
so that I can show you that this file will stay

49
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,780
persist through reboot. I can pull the
USB stick out of the machine and it will still

50
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:13,240
be there, so all I typed in the document is
"AAA..." repeated. Let's go ahead and save

51
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:27,680
that and close it. Now I am going to reboot the machine
or better yet, let's power off. So I'm powering

52
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:43,370
off the machine and it's going to shut down
completely. here I pulled the USB stick

53
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:51,300
out of the machine. The machine is powered
off. You can actually see that there is nothing

54
00:06:51,300 --> 00:07:02,370
plugged into it. There are no cables or anything
of the kind. Plug it back in.

55
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:15,730
Let's boot the machine. Go ahead and
enter BIOS again. I'm pressing F2

56
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:28,090
for Dell. Yours might be different. Just reminding
you once again. Any time now, my good man.

57
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:37,020
So let's go over to legacy. I still can't see USB here, which is perfectly fine. Exit disregarding

58
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:53,810
changes, ctrl-alt-del. I'll press F12 for boot options.
Okay, so USB storage device, boot from a USB.

59
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:02,350
Go down to live USB with encrypted
persistence. it will ask me to decrypt all

60
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:09,610
the drives again, so I won't explain that procedure.
I'll just to go quickly through it.

61
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,760
I am only decrypting the USB drive. I have
the option to decrypt all of my partitions

62
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:36,320
on this list, but I am not going to do that. That would defeat the purpose of this whole exercise. 
SDB3 test. I just put in a

63
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:44,050
generic key test for reference sake.
I'm going to destroy the contents

64
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:50,310
of this USB the moment I am done with this
tutorial, so I can use it for something else.

65
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,220
I will use this opportunity to remind everybody that
you can ask in the discussion

66
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,430
section if you would like me to show you how to create a live USB with

67
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,029
some other Linux distribution as well. So
feel free, if you have some other distribution to go

68
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:09,910
to the discussion section and just say, "Hey!
Can you show us how to create a live

69
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,630
version of this distribution, etc." I will be happy to do it, but please select

70
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,370
some of the major distributions. Don't go out and
for example, select Slackware or something

71
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:26,020
of a kind because that will be very useful
to you in general. Although it is fantastic,

72
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:32,500
Slackware is not exactly Linux as the
community says, but it is fairly similar. Anyway,

73
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:45,050
so it says "whatever." Let's just double-click on
it. I have a file here called Something.

74
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:52,900
Look! It's filled out with "AAA..." on it.
I have managed to make a persistent live

75
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,690
USB with encrypted storage that is greater
than 4GB. That is only by the size

76
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:08,210
of your USB. This is fully functional.
It works no problems. It's all functional.

77
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,920
If you have any questions or would like to
request additional content on this subject,

78
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,060
please feel free to go to the discussion section.
One more thing that I would like to remind you

79
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,680
of is that you should not expect that this setup

80
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,649
will work with dual monitors or something
of a kind. I mean you can set it

81
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:36,670
up to some through a complex procedure or
something of a kind, but generally it won't

82
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:43,860
work. These things are made just to boot off laptops
and to be used on a laptop. Anyway,

83
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,050
I bid you all farewell. I hope to see you
in the following tutorial!
