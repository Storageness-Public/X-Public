1
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:07,619
Welcome all to this tutorial. Today, I decided
to help you all out because I've noticed that

2
00:00:07,619 --> 00:00:18,369
a lot of you were struggling with creating
a live USB of Kali and I noticed that a lot

3
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:25,330
of people have been following a lot of strange
guides on the net. I can't really blame you

4
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:33,360
for this. I tend to do that as well. Here
today, I will show you how you can create

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:42,070
a bootable USB of Kali and how can it be functional.
It's very easy. It's not that hard. I am sure

6
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:48,440
you will all be able to replicate this procedure.
If you have any questions, as always just

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,410
go to the Udemy discussions and I'll be happy
to help you out any way I can. So first off,

8
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,780
I am assuming that you have VirtualBox installed,
up and running, you have guest additions and

9
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:10,299
extensions up and running for VirtualBox.
This is the first assumption that I am making

10
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:16,499
here. Of course, there are other ways to achieve
this. If you already have Kali

11
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:24,880
installed on your machine, that is also fine,
but you will need VirtualBox anyway. So you

12
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,299
have either installed Kali on your physical
machine or you have a virtual machine of Kali

13
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,719
within the VirtualBox with all the extensions
and guest additions installed. If you using

14
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,490
VMware, because I've noticed that some people
have used VMware, I am not sure why-- toolbox

15
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:48,469
VirtualBox is free-- but you will need to be able to
pass that USB to your machine if you want

16
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:59,159
to do this part. So, only if you want
to create a live USB with

17
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,479
persistent storage that is greater than 4
GB should you watch these tutorials. If you

18
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,940
don't care about 
making a bootable USB, feel free to skim through

19
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,610
these tutorials. I won't be dealing with
anything else here, I just want to show you

20
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:25,200
how to create this live USB that you can use.
Now, let's go about plugging in the USB stick.

21
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,720
I'm assuming that you have one USB
stick whose size is greater than 8 GB.

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,810
Mine is 64 and I recommend that you have 3.0 one, but
if you don't it's fine. I personally don't

23
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:45,300
have a stick that's 3.0. If
you do, it is not a bad idea to use it because the

24
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,870
speed. Since you will be using it your system will be a bit faster as well. However,

25
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,900
it is not mandatory, or anything of the kind.
Anyway, let's go ahead and right-click on your

26
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,730
Kali virtual machine. Keep in mind that my
Kali virtual machine is powered off, so you're

27
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:13,870
system needs to be powered off for this portion as
well. Go into settings, go into USB. I'm just going to go

28
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:20,720
ahead and remove this filter. Select enable
USB 2.0 EHCI controller. Then, click on the green

29
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:30,340
plus here and find your USB stick. Here is
mine, then say, Okay. Now I've listed the prerequisites

30
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,680
for this. All the prerequisites are provided
in this course. Just go back a few tutorials and

31
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,990
you will find how to install extensions, how
to install guest additions, how to install

32
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:51,970
VirtualBox etc. All of this is provided in
the lectures above. So anyway, now that we passed a

33
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,400
USB to the Kali machine. So I have a USB
stick plugged into my physical machine and

34
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,220
now I have just passed it to Kali machine, or my
virtual machine, from my physical machine.

35
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:12,810
Now, I will start Kali. So, let's get started. This from my previous settings,

36
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:25,430
forget that you saw this. Erase it
from your minds. There we go, it's booting.

37
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:44,770
So press enter, here. Okay, well the boot time is usually not the
fastest. That's why I like to boot the machine before I start

38
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,990
the tutorial. In this particular case,
it was kind difficult. Anyway, we're going to go

39
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:56,590
ahead and start with this in a moment. Now,
keep in mind, even though this procedure should

40
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,219
be valid to do from other operating systems,
like from Fedora, when I repeated the same

41
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:09,740
procedure from Fedora, it didn't work. So that was
painful. I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't

42
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,430
work because the procedure is pretty much
exactly the same on Kali, as well.

43
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:24,240
It just didn't work. The guide, the method that I've chosen
to use for this particular tutorial is the

44
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,529
method that is posted on the official Kali
website. Here, I will show you so you can follow

45
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:47,900
it through as well. You can use it as a
reference point. 
There we go, I think this is the one.

46
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:55,069
Over on this website just type in,
"making a persistent,"I'll just show you the URL.

47
00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:11,379
Hopefully you can see the address.

48
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:22,479
It's listed right
here. The method is pretty simple. I didn't show it for

49
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,460
long, but if you want to retype it pause the
video or you can just use a search engine

50
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,759
and type in how to create a bootable USB off
Kali and then just select the official website.

51
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,090
Not a big deal. I personally think it's far
easier method. Anyway, over here you have the

52
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:46,949
guide we will be using DD. So, this is the command that we are going

53
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:54,759
to need and this is quite literally it. Before
we actually can use this command, we need

54
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:03,279
to pass the USB to the virtual
machine or something like that and you see

55
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:09,639
here says you need to first figure out what
the name of it is. I will explain

56
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:16,969
this in greater detail, no worries there. You see this is it, quite literally. Other ones

57
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:25,580
are for other machines. You see this is
for how to do it in Windows. Personally,

58
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,610
the method that I'm using can be using any
system as long as you have VirtualBox and Kali

59
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:35,729
installed. So, it's pretty simple. This
is all this is the entire guide for doing

60
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:44,599
it in Linux. This is the whole guide.
If you have a virtual machine on Mac OSX

61
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:53,659
or on a Windows, you can still follow the same
method. You can still do the same thing that I'm

62
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:58,779
doing. If you don't really feel like doing
what I'm doing now, you can go ahead and follow

63
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:05,930
one of these other two guides. I really haven't
tested them out at all, as I see this is

64
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:12,479
a more universal way of doing things. In the previous tutorials most

65
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,319
of you have tried to install VirtualBox and
have already installed Kali and so on.

66
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:25,999
I think this method will cover the largest possible audience. Before we begin, let me

67
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:32,700
clear up a few things this method that I'm
doing to use works for Kali, within Kali. So,

68
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,719
you need to do this from Kali and you need
to create a Kali with this method, bootable

69
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:43,810
USB. I have tried to do the same thing for
some other destros, I haven't tried any

70
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:48,339
other debian based distros, I have tried with
Fedora or something and didn't

71
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:56,329
work. I don't know why. I didn't really investigate to the
largest of extends, but it just failed.

72
00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:01,949
So, I can't tell you if you it will work. Maybe for
you it will with other distributions, but I

73
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:08,980
don't know there are no guarantees. If, however, you
would like me to do a demonstration on how

74
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:16,940
to create live USB's with persistence with
some other Linux distributions such as Ubuntu or Fedora

75
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:25,430
or I don't know, centOS, Linux Mint
or something like that, just let me know in the

76
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,980
discussion sections. Just ask it of me and
I'll see what I can do. Those

77
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:37,230
videos are relatively simple to do, so I will
do them for you. I will try to find the most

78
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:44,230
universal way of doing it. You can for
example say,

79
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,800
"Hey, Erman. I'd like you to show me how can I do this from
windows?" or "Hey, I know you're running Fedora as your main

80
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,490
system but I would really like to show me
how to do this from Ubuntu. Like how to create

81
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:05,029
a live USB of Mint from Ubuntu." Just
specifying what you want. Specify from which

82
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:10,269
operating system you want me to do this and you have 99% chance

83
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:15,519
that I will do this, that I will provide you with
videos. I can't guarantee it within a couple

84
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,230
of hours, but I will provide it, no worries.  Also,
you cannot ask me to do this from

85
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:30,160
a Mac because I don't have a Mac. I don't have
OSX and I really can't do it. However, this procedure

86
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,930
that I'm using now, if you have a VirtualBox
within Mac, it will work for Kali. If you need advice,

87
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,350
feel free to ask it of me in the
discussion section. Just one more time

88
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:48,300
before we proceed, if you want a different
set up, if you want to create a live USB

89
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,050
of a different distro from a different
environment, just ask of me in the discussions

90
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:59,759
and I will most likely be able to provide
you with those videos. I wanted to make

91
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:10,750
that point rather clear. Let us begin! Open
up a terminal. I will go ahead

92
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:20,569
and expand it. Type in 'su', well you won't need to
if you're root already. I'll type, clear. Now, what you will

93
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:26,350
need for this tutorial, as well, will be a Kali Linux image. I'm guessing that

94
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:35,600
you don't have a downloaded within your virtual
machine. So, go ahead and download it. Just type in, "Kali."

95
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:52,230
Go ahead and
download one of one of these two.

96
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:58,000
One of the two first ones, either direct ISO or the Torrent. So, if you're doing this in Linux you can also

97
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,730
check the sha1 sum, which is fairly simple
to do. Let me just go ahead and show

98
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:09,850
you how you check the sha
sums to verify that your download is correct.

99
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:16,699
So, I've already conducted the download, and
have an image here. See it's Kali Linux.

100
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:28,410
All I have to do is type in
'sha1sum Kali-linux.' I will put this

101
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:38,579
in a file called test. Now,
this command will use this file and it

102
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:44,139
will generate the sha1 sum and then we will be able

103
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:50,870
to compare it with this one. If they match it is exactly the same file. If they

104
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:59,370
do not match your download is corrupt. Simply
go and download it again. This might take a bit of

105
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,990
time. Nothing too long, though it might take a little bit of

106
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:11,029
time. It is very important to verify that your downloads
are correct, especially when doing this method.

107
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:19,139
You can have a corrupt download and
then you can attempt to create a bootable USB

108
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,100
like 50 times and none of those 50 tries
will work because you won't get any messages

109
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,850
and you simply won't be able to boot. Okay, we've done that. Let's go ahead and cat test

110
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:38,839
and you see we got this sum for this file. So, how do we compare

111
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:45,449
it to this file here? Well, you
could of course put one file next to another

112
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:51,930
and then you could look at the numbers and
letters. Yeah, let's not do that. Let's cat out test

113
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:59,379
and the grep the exact pattern. So, if we can 
grep the exact pattern it means that they match

114
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:07,060
and they do match. The download is correct.
Excellent! So, now we have that sorted out.

115
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:28,560
Let's go ahead and use fdisk-l. Okay, so
be last one SDB that's my USB.

116
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,500
For you, it would most likely be the same
name: SDB. Keep in mind that whatever

117
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:40,829
you have in your USB will be destroyed-- gone
permanently-- no more! Just go ahead and purify it.

118
00:14:40,829 --> 00:15:00,230
Go ahead and type 'fdisk/dev/sdb.' Use the 'd' command to delete the partitions.

119
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:08,810
So, right. The table has now been altered.

120
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:24,009
Alright, the kernel
still uses the old table. Let's reload it. Warning,

121
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:31,249
unable to open... Okay, who cares about that? That's not a problem.By the way sro0 is the CD drive. I could

122
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:38,079
care less about that for the time being. partition
three on dev/sdb have been written but we were

123
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:49,129
unable to informed Kernel of the change. probably because
it is in use. Okay, so apparently it's in use. Nevermind.

124
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:59,449
Let's go ahead and use gparted. These are also the problems that you

125
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:05,050
will encounter, even though I have conducted
test runs. That is why I actually have those

126
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:11,240
partitions set up on the USB drive as they
are. Excellent, so, gparted actually sees

127
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:19,560
that we have deleted pretty much everything
there, which is very nice. We're going go

128
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:29,040
ahead and close gparted because we don't
need it. Type: fdisk-l

129
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,839
Excellent. So, we no longer see the partitions
because there are no partitions and it says

130
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:47,230
dev/sdb. My drive is 64 GB but I can only utilize
62.5. Not a huge loss. Now, all we need

131
00:16:47,230 --> 00:17:01,170
to do is type in, dd if (meaning
input file) =/home/test/downloads/kali

132
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:11,079
Now keep in mind, the path to your ISO image may be different than mine. Figure out where

133
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,400
your download is. It's probably in the downloads
folder of the current user. My current user

134
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,770
is test, your current user can be root or something
like that. Please, keep that in mind.

135
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:37,500
Then type in 
output file so 'of=/dev/sdb bs=512k'

136
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,730
that is the writing speed. You
can actually increase this to reduce the amount

137
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,250
of time needed but the bigger the bigger the
writing speed, the last time you need but the bigger

138
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:55,390
the chance of an error. So, keep that in mind.
On the forums and elsewhere they say that dd

139
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:03,190
is not a viable way to do this because
of possible errors. A moment ago I actually

140
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,960
tested it out and I have invested time and
effort to test out a lot of other methods as

141
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,919
well and I really did find this one is pretty
much the easiest and the most universal.

142
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,090
I'm going to go ahead and press enter
and this is going to start. Because this

143
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:25,870
this is a virtual machine, this can take quite
a while. I mean a significant amount of time!

144
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:31,770
I think it took like 15 minutes or something
like that the last time I ran the command.

145
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:37,179
I'm running slowly out of time here. Before
I run out of time, let's look at it this way.

146
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:43,710
You cannot see any progress bars or anything here, however, if you take a look at your USB

147
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:49,610
and if it has any such flashing of lights
on it, as long as it is flashing an operation

148
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:55,730
is being performed. That USB devices being utilized,
something is being done with it. Most likely,

149
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:03,340
the dd is writing files to it. So, don't worry
just let it run and complete it's cycle. Don't interrupt

150
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:09,809
it, just let it finish until the end. No big
deal. Go have a cup coffee or something.

151
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:15,970
I will hold the tutorial here and I'll come back
when it's done for part two. Until then, I bid

152
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:16,809
you all farewell.
