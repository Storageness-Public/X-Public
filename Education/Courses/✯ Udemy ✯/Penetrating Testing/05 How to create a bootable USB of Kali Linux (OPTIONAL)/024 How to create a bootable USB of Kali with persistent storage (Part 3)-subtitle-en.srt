1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:07,160
Okay, so â€“ that took a lot of time to finish.
Not sure how long it took on your system,

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:14,099
but on mine it took a lot of time. I watched
like 10 YouTube videos or something like that.

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:23,940
I'm not sure how long they were, yet you get
the idea. Anyway, from here onward we can

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:30,140
just copy most of these commands. That's exactly
what I shall do. You can make own mount point

5
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:37,870
or you can just go ahead and copy this one.
I mean, no big deal-- whatever. Then we can

6
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,480
go ahead and mount this one. Since we used
the same names, we can just copy and paste.

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,880
Let's just verify. Yes, there we go. The mount
has went up perfectly. Then, we need to go

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:01:02,239
ahead and do this. We will echo this line
into this file located here. What is this

9
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:14,580
that I have selected now? That is the mount
point of our storage. So, my USB we have just

10
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:25,720
formatted with LUKS. We can feel free to unmount
it. First, press enter. Let's go ahead and

11
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,590
unmount it. Then, it says close the encrypted
channel to our persistent partition. We can

12
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:40,869
basically just go in to and close it with
crypt. Make sure to know the password. There

13
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:46,840
we go! This shouldn't be accessible anymore.
Then, that is literally it. There is nothing

14
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,720
else that you need to do here. I'll just go
ahead and explain a little bit with this portion

15
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,729
where you don't have encryption. I mean, it's
fairly similar, pretty much the same, actually.

16
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:11,760
Okay, I'll just go and see. This part, you
don't actually need to copy and paste. Just

17
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,590
go ahead and use the FDISK, as I have used
it, and create a another partition. So, that

18
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,630
that part is the same. Just use FDISK as we
have used it before.

19
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:31,819
Fdisk, space-- like this "fdisk /dev/DEVICENAME"
-- the device name should be USB or SDB or

20
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:39,030
whatever it is. You can figure out what it
is with "-L option" and see it here. So you

21
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:46,660
will need to format it. If it is SDB3, you
can go ahead and copy paste this. Then go

22
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:54,120
ahead and copy paste this as well. So, no
big deal there at all. Then, I just keep copy

23
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,680
pasting until the end. The only thing that
you will need to change it is SDB3-- maybe.

24
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,370
As I said, check it out with your fdisk and
figure out what it is. Just go ahead and create

25
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:14,069
a partition with fdisk, as I have shown as
I have showed you in the previous tutorial.

26
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:27,550
This segment here took a lot of time. I mean,
a lot! So don't be discouraged. If the thinking

27
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,920
that the system is blocked or there is a bug
or something. Know it just takes a lot of

28
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,030
time in a virtual machine. That's the fact
of the matter, and it has something to do

29
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:46,150
with the fact that I have a pretty large USB
stick. Anyway, keep all that in mind. Now,

30
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,970
everything is done here. I shall now reboot
it to my Kali machine. I will use my phone

31
00:03:51,970 --> 00:04:02,459
just to give you some images. There is nothing
that you need to do pretty much. We've created

32
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,700
a live USB with encrypted persistence. Just
select live USB and encrypted persistence

33
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,739
when it boots. I'm going to do some shooting
with my phone. The image is not to be great

34
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,049
because my new phone is still not here and
this camera is terrible. It doesn't really

35
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:24,259
matter that much because there is nothing
that you need to do. Everything is set up.

36
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:29,219
Everything is ready. Everything is working.
All you need to do is boot from the new USB.

37
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:34,080
I'm just going to record it to prove that
it functions. If it doesn't function for you,

38
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,919
you might be doing something wrong. Let me
know in the discussion section. We'll discuss

39
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,719
it there and see how it works. Let me just
remind everybody

40
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:55,520
before we start that, you shouldn't expect
multiple monitors to work. That's just not

41
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,240
going to happen easily at all. You will need
to mess around with the drivers and personally

42
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,169
that's not a good idea, especially not for
a bootable USB. Second, if wireless doesn't

43
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:13,339
work, you need to fix that. You can do it
with drivers. Think about it for second. If

44
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:19,259
you have a wireless card within your machine
and doesn't support a lot of things, like

45
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:26,589
aircrack or something, or that is supported
in Kali. Why bother with the drivers at all,

46
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:31,180
if it's not going to connect. You'll still
be able to connect to the wireless access

47
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,539
point, but I mean you won't be able to do
half of the stuff with wireless, so why bother.

48
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:41,219
I suggest getting another wireless USB adapter
which you can just plug-n-play and it will

49
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:54,289
work. Anyway, I am going to close my virtual
machine and then I'm gonna go ahead and boot

50
00:05:54,289 --> 00:06:00,089
from my USB drive and record this for my phone.
Please don't hang me if the images of the

51
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:05,899
qualities not super great or something like
that. From this point on, There is no more

52
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,659
configuration. There is nothing else to do
need to do. The only reason that I'm shooting

53
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:17,199
at this next segment is so I can show you
the the boot does indeed work. You can actually

54
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,199
boot from a live USB without any problems.
That it is functional, and the procedure is

55
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,139
working. So, let's get into that.
