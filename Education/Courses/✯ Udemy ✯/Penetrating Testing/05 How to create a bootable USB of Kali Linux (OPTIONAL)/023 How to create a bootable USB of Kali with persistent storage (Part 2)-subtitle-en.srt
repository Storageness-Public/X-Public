1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,390
Welcome back everybody.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:11,550
So this process has finished and you're supposed to get a output like this.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,910
Cohen took three point on gigabytes.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,550
Let's take this one more time.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,770
And we see that it has created this has created two partitions.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,730
No big deal there.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,190
That's supposed to go like that.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,460
So let's go ahead and clear the screen and start you parse it one more time.

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,910
Wait for it to start.

10
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,260
Select this TB X on.

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,820
So there is the boot partition.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:56,380
There is the color you live FAT 32 and then we have 55 gigabytes of allocated space.

13
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,500
So we will format this to a different type of a partition but let's first take a look at what guide

14
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,690
what the guide says.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,700
I believe they have instructed us to formatted as ex-state 3 instead of 64.

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,610
I suppose it's due to some compatibility issues or something of a kind.

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,410
Even this is FAT 16 instead of FAT 32 but ok.

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,360
No big deal there.

19
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,030
Let's go back to their site and see what else do we have to do.

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,700
So as far as the as far as the storage is concerned as far as the live US is concerned that would literally

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:35,100
be it as far as this guy says and I haven't detested this out at this point of time.

22
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,800
There is nothing else that you need to do.

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,740
You can just literally plug your you is me into your machine and set your physical machine to boot for

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,540
me you will be in bio in BIOS on Dell machines because I have a Dell machine.

25
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:56,560
You press F 2 or F F 12 at boot time and you can select the boot options on some other machines something

26
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,490
like Acer or HP.

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,370
You use different keys but no worries.

28
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,160
Just reboot the machine and you will see the key.

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,270
Like somewhere in the bottom right corner or the bottom left corner somewhere at butan you will see

30
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,830
press to enter setup or something anyway.

31
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,570
So as I said there is nothing else that you need to do.

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,670
This is it.

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,180
You now have a live Juez B.

34
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,210
However if you would like to have some persistent storage.

35
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,640
Well that's another thing entirely.

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,870
And let's go about things.

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,860
So let's go ahead and find the guide for persistent storage.

38
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,450
I just want you to be able to use that as a reference.

39
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,020
So I'm just going to type it in here.

40
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:47,150
Culley next to us the file systems

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,760
is this.

42
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,270
Yup this is the one.

43
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:03,310
So look it says call it Linux Live has two options the default boot menu which enable persistence.

44
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,730
So first of all you have the life persistence and the live use be it cryptic persistence.

45
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:15,300
I would I would personally recommend that you just use the live use be persistence.

46
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:23,730
You can go with the encrypted one as well but that is completely your choice.

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:31,350
So you know what let's go ahead and see how this works with the Locsin encryption.

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:39,010
However you know if you forget your key if you don't use your USP for a while or something like that

49
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,670
and you forget your key you will never again.

50
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,970
And I mean never again if you've selected the complicated enough in a long enough encryption key you

51
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:55,060
will never again be able to access that information will be lost to you gone completely.

52
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:06,430
So please keep that in mind because when creating encrypted things if you're going to use it fine.

53
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:12,190
No problems if you're not going to use it and you're going to leave it standing somewhere lying around

54
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:18,710
somewhere and forget the key and then lose all your data.

55
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,400
Think about it.

56
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,620
Is it really worth it.

57
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:27,870
Do you have anything on that stick that's that important that you absolutely need to encrypt the data

58
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,000
much.

59
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,280
Think about it just see if it's worth it at all.

60
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:41,860
So let's go and see what the guy below says both guides are fairly similar and they function on very

61
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,850
similar costs.

62
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,930
They function in a very similar concept.

63
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,220
They just use a bit of a different partitioning.

64
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,040
So alternatively you can create Luxon encrypt persistent storage area.

65
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,840
This is an extra layer of security.

66
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,680
And the following example.

67
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,600
OK so what does it say will create a new partition to store a persistent data and starting right above

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,340
the second call the life dition and then adding 70 gigabytes.

69
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,760
So you don't really need this.

70
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,370
So we're just going to go ahead and skip that set up blocks encryption and you partition put the next

71
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,860
default system on it and create persistence dot com file.

72
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,610
Ok so this persistence can file.

73
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:30,460
We will definitely need this and we will need a Luchs setup.

74
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:40,040
So they have this command that you can I'm pretty sure you can copy this or anything of a kind.

75
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,870
So it's not going to work the way you want it to work.

76
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:51,270
So that's why we're going to have to do this ourselves down below.

77
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:57,120
So we have crypto set up and system to set up looks open.

78
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,520
OK so devastated B-3 my USPSA That's the third partition.

79
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,170
So we need to make a partition.

80
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:12,090
Open it up with locks and well formatted with locks then open it with locks that formatted with exit

81
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,210
three false system.

82
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:23,360
Give it a label and then we need to create this persistence file here and then we need to go ahead and

83
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,320
close it once it's closed just reboot the machine and the next time it boots just select the live use

84
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:36,650
be with persistence alive is be with persistent encrypted Ligers be with persistence and you will be

85
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,360
prompted for a key.

86
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:46,040
And now I can't really show this as I'm recording so I'll see if I can use my cell phone camera to record

87
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:52,730
the screen as I boot because keep in mind when you put a live version of Cali you're going to encounter

88
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:59,600
some problems for the very first problem that you will encounter is if you're working on multiple screens

89
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,700
like I.

90
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,600
Yeah.

91
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,750
Cali live Cali is just not going to see them.

92
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,060
So you can kiss that goodbye.

93
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,550
This is primarily for you using it on your laptop or your desktop machine somewhere.

94
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,480
It will not work with multiple monitor setups.

95
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,490
Also you might encounter some problems with Wi-Fi.

96
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,900
That just means that you don't have the proper drivers installed.

97
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:34,160
That is it for Wi-Fi use be adapters you can go ahead and check out lecture's 35 and 36.

98
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,870
I do believe that I have explained it in great detail.

99
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,350
Which one you can use that is practically guaranteed to work although there are other ones that are

100
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,240
guaranteed to work as well.

101
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,160
I just picked that one because it was cheap and it was supplied in great abundance on eBay.

102
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,770
So let's let's begin shall we.

103
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,560
So that's part of it.

104
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,500
And we're not going to need you parted now.

105
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,680
I just want these things here.

106
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,970
So show what shall we do first step in this space of this space.

107
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:19,780
Well OK so it says the b f this space of STV open it up press.

108
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:25,050
And because we wanted to create a new one it will be a primary partition.

109
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,040
You can have four primary partitions partition numbers so its default is three.

110
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,110
Because look we already have one and then we have two.

111
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,670
And since you can only have four it's one to four.

112
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,290
And we're going to go ahead and create a third one.

113
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,340
So three first sector.

114
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:50,290
OK the first sector is the last sector of SATB.

115
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,450
So you can see that this one and this one are pretty much the same so it just this one ends.

116
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,900
But for this was in answer to 103.

117
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:07,700
So just the next one that's fine just press enter and now you can define the size so it's as a last

118
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,510
sector plus sectors or plus size.

119
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,390
So look you can basically if you don't want to take your entire week type in plus and then see then

120
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,570
gee that would b plus then gigabytes.

121
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,460
Sorry let me just explain this

122
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,020
what is the problem.

123
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,600
Sorry that seems to have gotten stuck.

124
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,460
So new primary three term

125
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:51,070
exons So now I can say it like plus 10 G and B plus them gigabytes and that would be the next partition

126
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,160
or I could actually specify the set of sectors I would like but I would just like it to basically take

127
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,390
the rest of my the rest of available space.

128
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:06,400
So this is the last possible secretary that is going to take and this will be the occupied sectors there

129
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,110
should be roughly around.

130
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:19,030
I don't know let's see maybe 40 gig 40 50 gig or something like that doesn't really matter it's just

131
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,950
going to take the rest of the space that's available just press enter and use the default one says using

132
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,090
default value.

133
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,960
Now press W2 right.

134
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,560
OK so warning.

135
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:39,470
Rereading the two filters 16 device or resource busy the kernel still use the old table.

136
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,070
OK so let's go ahead and type in the space age

137
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,510
CB2 is mounted amount of too.

138
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,670
I don't really want it.

139
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:05,370
OK so let's go ahead and attempt this again the full.

140
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,510
Hopefully it has loaded its part.

141
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,390
Will you succeed.

142
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,240
Unable to.

143
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,610
OK.

144
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,630
So we have successfully done that found a mistaken if this space dush else.

145
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,450
Yup we have.

146
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:25,900
So we indeed have managed to formatted format formatted we have managed to partition it and we have

147
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,240
gotten that extra partition.

148
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,020
So the next steps that we're going to need to do.

149
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,700
I'm just going to go ahead and use this use a little bit of this guide here because I honestly haven't

150
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,100
used locks.

151
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:44,150
I haven't formatted anything with locks in a really long time primarily because I didn't really need

152
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:52,870
to form a hidden thing with Luxx you usually do it once when you install your system and you don't do

153
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,010
it like ever again because there is no need.

154
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,020
You're only going to encrypt your drives once and that's it.

155
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,160
You're never going to mess with them again.

156
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,670
And that's exactly what I'm saying.

157
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:09,610
So if you don't use them on a daily basis or something like that if you have a complex key out you're

158
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,820
most likely going to have to say goodbye to your data at a certain point of time.

159
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:23,370
OK so now I can just pretty much copy paste this command because my drive my partition is called S-D

160
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:23,840
beat.

161
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,490
If yours is called differently please change accordingly.

162
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:33,130
Base it's crypto set up for Bowse verify password locks formats and we're just formatting this with

163
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,920
locks and a partition is Esty the device is a sleepy and the partition is three.

164
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,120
Please verify that this is the device and that this is the partition because yours might be different.

165
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,180
Could be the D-3 or Esti C-3 or something of a kind.

166
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,630
I don't know.

167
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,770
Just check.

168
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,470
Most likely will be the same but check it anyway.

169
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,560
Let's go ahead and press enter.

170
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,740
Warning it will overwrite the data.

171
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,260
Yes command failed in voevoda argument.

172
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,090
Got them on the ass.

173
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,900
Enter a passphrase so I'm going to go ahead and type in test.

174
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,080
Be very very careful what you type in here.

175
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,500
Once locked once encrypted if the password is complex enough you will never again be able to decrypt

176
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,380
it without a proper passphrase.

177
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:34,340
So forget about if you saw the thing in the movies like when they break the encryption on the drive

178
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,020
or something like it.

179
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,440
It just doesn't happen if the passphrase is complex enough.

180
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,320
It doesn't matter how fast your computer is it doesn't.

181
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,400
You can use the Google data center and utilize all the processors and all the old the graphics cards

182
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:58,990
and GPU use and use and whatever else you can think of and you can generate billions upon billions upon

183
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:07,480
billions upon billions of passwords and keys a second would take you about 20 years to decrypt.

184
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,520
He could pass a good key.

185
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,640
So yeah imagine how long it would take like a regular PC to do it.

186
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:22,770
Like forget about that that's one of that's one of the reasons I'm mistaken like in some countries where

187
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:31,020
the authorities can hold the encrypted drives indefinitely because it takes a ridiculous amount of time

188
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,340
to decrypt them and it's even questionable whether ever they will be decrypted because of the amount

189
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,860
of resources that have to be devoted to such a task.

190
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,150
Again I repeat myself I'm really sorry if I'm boring or something like that but it's very important

191
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:54,260
today to remember the passphrase because you won't be able to come to me in the discussion section and

192
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,370
say hey you know my passphrase doesn't work.

193
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,830
So I'm not going to be able to do anything about it.

194
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:06,160
It doesn't matter if my remote into your system or something like that completely irrelevant.

195
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,060
There will be nothing and I mean literally nothing that I will be able to do about it.

196
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:19,460
Please remember it a passphrase if you are opting for this setup or just type in something extremely

197
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:25,370
simple that you will be able to remember anyway enough about it enough about my Enough of my paranoid

198
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,450
chatter here.

199
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,390
Let's go ahead and do this.

200
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,090
So why is it called My b.

201
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,930
Have you made it.

202
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,650
OK.

203
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,780
OK.

204
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:43,210
So you can let it be my USPS fine.

205
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,600
So enter passphrase.

206
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,600
What is the passphrase that you just typed in.

207
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,500
There we go.

208
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,740
We have managed to open it.

209
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:58,750
If you fail if you fail this this one that you typed in here and this one for disks they are exactly

210
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,630
the same.

211
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,880
So no worries there.

212
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,090
And now we can go ahead and create this we can format it.

213
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:14,160
So just go ahead and formatted with extra 3 with label persistence.

214
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,970
And this is the device that we will be formatting.

215
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,710
This should take a while.

216
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,000
I mean it shouldn't take too long but it's going to take a while.

217
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,130
Definitely.

218
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:31,210
Sorry that's come on come on come on come C'mon.

219
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,030
It really hit it right in the middle of a story.

220
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,770
Get a waiting thing like this.

221
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:46,660
And you have done some test runs without the encryption so without the encryption everything seemed

222
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,840
to have worked out just fine without any problems.

223
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,490
And the principle is exactly the same.

224
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,960
All you need to do is create another partition.

225
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:04,750
The only difference between this one and the one without encryption is basically the locks set up so

226
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,410
that the data would be encrypted.

227
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,100
That's it.

228
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,650
But it's not a bad idea.

229
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,630
I mean it's a good concept to protect your information and all of that.

230
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,240
But in any case I am running out of time and I don't think this is going to finish in any reasonable

231
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,460
amount of time.

232
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,000
At some point of time I swear I'm going to get to another computer and I'm going to have the Senate

233
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:31,570
running as a virtualise which is going to work crazy fast because it gives like 95 percent of native

234
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,010
performance anyway.

235
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,820
I'm going to bid you farewell here and then we're going to continue in the follow up to Tauriel.

236
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,210
And before I leave.

237
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:47,450
I sincerely hope that the God that I have chosen is simple enough and the set up is simple enough.

238
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:58,360
If you would like me to create instructions for other other distributions as I have said feel free to

239
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,180
just let me know in the discussion section by.
