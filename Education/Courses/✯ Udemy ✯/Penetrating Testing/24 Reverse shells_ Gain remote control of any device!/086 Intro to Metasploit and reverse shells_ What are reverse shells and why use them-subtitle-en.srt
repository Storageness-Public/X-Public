00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,030
Welcome everybody to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,030
Today, I will open up
a chapter on reverse shells.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,880
Now, let me begin by just explaining
what they are in general.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,057
Basically, a reverse shell would be
something that you put a piece of code,

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:20,609
that you would place on a device,
mainly on a computer.

6
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,201
But you can also place it on a phone and
pretty much SmartPhone like an Android

7
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:28,089
device, or an iPhone,
or something of a kind.

8
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:32,383
And then you are able
to control such devices

9
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:36,688
remotely from the location of your choice.

10
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:40,981
Now, to do this over the Internet,
it's a little bit trickier and

11
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:45,748
you would have to combine several things,
what we have learned thus far.

12
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:52,786
For example, you would have to first,
if you had a computer at home and

13
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,960
if you didn't have a VPN with a static IP,

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,520
you would need to
configure your own router.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,517
Well actually it's not that hard,

16
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:06,920
all you would need to do is put
an IP address of your computer.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,198
So I have config, you can also use
the IP of a virtual machine no problem.

18
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,159
If it's in the bridge mode
as I have showed you.

19
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,451
And you would need to find an option DMZ,
so

20
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:21,298
demilitarized zone as it
is usually referred to.

21
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:24,899
And you would basically
put this IP address.

22
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:27,938
Keep in mind if it changes that
you need to put it back in.

23
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:30,258
That you need to change the DMZ as well.

24
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:35,337
I've decided not to show you how to do
this on a router because I could only show

25
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:40,199
you how to do it on my own router, and
there are various routers out there.

26
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,859
But, look, it's pretty simple.

27
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:47,779
Just open up your Web interface
of a router, and find DMZ.

28
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:50,258
So DMZ.

29
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:53,678
There's usually just one option,
one field.

30
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:56,660
You can only put one IP address.

31
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,430
And just type in this IP address, and

32
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,730
then you will be able to
use your public IP address

33
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,650
which you can get by typing in your
favorite search engine, what is my IP.

34
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,701
Then get that public IP address, and you
can use that IP address as a listener for

35
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,650
all the reverse-shells you create.

36
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,134
Now, there are several approaches here,

37
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:20,888
in terms of deployment and
creation of a reverse-shell.

38
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:24,475
To create them you can
either code it yourself,

39
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:29,676
which is a preferable way primary
because the reverse shells that you

40
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:34,789
can generate automatically,
can be detected by anti viruses, and

41
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:40,728
that's not what you really want,
you want something that's undetectable.

42
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:44,893
But for the time, coding a reverse shell
on your own, I can tell you, it's not

43
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:49,061
a simple task, especially when you need
to do hex dumps to avoid privileges and

44
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,610
stuff of a kind,
to avoid firewall detection.

45
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,149
But look, basically if you code

46
00:02:57,149 --> 00:03:02,279
it yourself, it's probably

47
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:08,070
going to be something simple.

48
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:15,520
It's going to be far away from
professional, it's going to be bad.

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,920
Let's face the reality of things.

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,980
However, because it's bad,
because it's unprofessional,

51
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,820
because it doesn't contain any
complex functions, because it

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,400
doesn't contain the usual patterns that
a pro reverse shell would contain,

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,150
it is not that likely to
be detected by antiviruses.

54
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,810
So that's a big plus for you.

55
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,137
So if you can even code the basic reverse

56
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:47,988
shells, just look it up on the net.

57
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:48,501
I'm not gonna get into
that because that would be

58
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:49,088
a separate course for itself,
a programming course.

59
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:52,717
If you can code even
the basic reverse shells,

60
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:58,209
you stand a very good chance of not
getting detected primarily because

61
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:03,250
your reverse shells will be noobish,
and that's a good thing.

62
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,489
That can be a good thing, actually.

63
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:12,082
Anyway, it is unlikely that
you will pass the detection

64
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:16,604
by an automatically
generated reverse shell

65
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:21,490
on a fully updated system,
so keep that in mind.

66
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,051
You need to look for a system that
doesn't have the latest updates,

67
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:30,538
that is behind in such a sense.

68
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:35,839
And then you have a very good chance of
passing with an automated reverse shell.

69
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,276
The tool for or the framework for

70
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:43,739
creating reverse shells is Metasploit.

71
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:48,578
Metasploit is a fantastic framework used
by pen testers all around the world.

72
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:53,886
Now professionals use a paid version,
pro version, which costs,

73
00:04:53,886 --> 00:05:00,419
I remember a long time ago, I knew the
exact price, but it doesn't really matter.

74
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:06,730
It was around $5000, so
5k per license per month.

75
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,930
That costs quite a bit.

76
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,460
Things might have changed.

77
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,260
In the meantime, it's been a while
since I checked those prices out.

78
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,980
But I'm just trying to make a point that
even though the pen testing companies

79
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,480
are paying such prices, and
they're not paying it for

80
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,740
a single license,
usually they're paying for more than one.

81
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,160
Even though the program is open source.

82
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,674
If the program is open source,

83
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:31,600
that doesn't necessarily mean
that it's free of charge.

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,098
Of course,
we will be using a free of charge version.

85
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:38,840
You don't have a good interface there.

86
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,978
You have to do everything by terminal.

87
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:45,819
So that's kind of a down side for some but
not to the fullest of extents, and

88
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:51,218
there are some features that are only
available for the pro version.

89
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,624
However, if you feel
like paying 5k per month,

90
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:59,193
just go over on the net,
type in Metasploit in the search engine,

91
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:03,199
and your first result should
be their official website.

92
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,438
Anyway, without further ado, we're
gonna get into Metasploit immediately.

93
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:12,261
I'm gonna go ahead and
clear the screen and

94
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:17,060
we will use it to generate a script,
and we will also use it as a Listener.

95
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,850
Now, Metasploit, I mean you can run
it just by default in Kali without

96
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,720
actually doing any sort of
configuration of whatsoever.

97
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,080
But I don't recommend it.

98
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,762
Primarily because you can speed
up pretty much everything by

99
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:35,950
just doing a few simple things.

100
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,710
So go ahead and type in, service.

101
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,590
We will give Metasploit
framework a database to use.

102
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,629
And if it's use as
a database it is faster.

103
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,168
So type in postage, SQL.

104
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:49,488
Start.

105
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:51,729
You will need to start postage SQL.

106
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:53,030
It's already running for me.

107
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,060
I can just type in status.

108
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,940
And there you go,
it says running clusters.

109
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,610
Anyway.

110
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,400
Go ahead and clear the screen.

111
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,730
Type in service Metasploit.

112
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:07,940
Start.

113
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,358
And, this should start
the Metasploit service, as well.

114
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:15,598
I'm gonna type in status.

115
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:17,058
And, okay.

116
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:20,636
So there are a few things
that will start up,

117
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:25,060
once you type in service Metasploit start.

118
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,630
Anyway, go ahead and clear the screen.

119
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,808
Type in msfconsole.

120
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:31,128
Press Enter.

121
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:34,210
And and I gotta warn you.

122
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,150
This is gonna take a while,
actually, to start.

123
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:43,228
Primarily because Metasploit is pretty
big, it has a lot of things in it.

124
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:47,309
And it takes a while on a virtual
machine to actually start,

125
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:50,508
primarily because of
the limited resources.

126
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:56,928
Let me just go ahead and
open up another terminal and

127
00:07:56,928 --> 00:08:00,968
type in msfupdate, this is it.

128
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:04,452
Excellent.
So if you type in msfupdate in a root

129
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:09,328
terminal, it will update
the Metasploit framework.

130
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:14,145
I would suggest to do this
as often as possible, says,

131
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:20,300
note, expect weekly or
weekish updates using this method.

132
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,632
So, I mean, if you are,
if they issue weekly updates you should

133
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:29,540
definitely consider updating it at
least twice a week, just to be sure.

134
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,300
Just to make sure that you have those
latest updates readily available at hand.

135
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,050
Now this here, where it says,
username and security password line.

136
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,728
This is nothing, this is a banner.

137
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,748
Don't let that confuse you,
let me just show you.

138
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:43,668
Banner.

139
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:44,729
You see?

140
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:46,528
It changes, and then it changes again.

141
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:51,250
I don't know why, but
a lot of these banners are actually cows.

142
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,190
There is a logic to it.

143
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,890
But I'm gonna let you
actually figure that one out.

144
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,548
I'm pretty sure, I knew that a while ago,
but it doesn't really matter.

145
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:01,569
So, a cow, this one, Metasploit.

146
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:02,228
A cow again.

147
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:08,491
Cow again.

148
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:10,580
This sign, cow again.

149
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,887
So there we go,
you can just keep on typing in banner, and

150
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:12,858
it's gonna give you different banners.

151
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:16,661
I do believe that every
time you start Metasploit,

152
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:20,118
it does actually give
you a different banner.

153
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:22,485
Now go ahead and type in help,

154
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:27,841
just to see a ton load of options
that you have here that you can use.

155
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:33,220
And the usage of commands is pretty much

156
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,330
the same as in a Linux shell,
so don't worry about it.

157
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,410
What you have used thus far,
you can use here.

158
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:44,480
You see I've changed directory,
okay, for a change of banner back.

159
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,891
Now instead of using cd space ..,
you would use

160
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:53,850
back to exit a current payload or
exploit or whatever.

161
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:59,800
Anyway you can apparently,
can even change colors.

162
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,630
I'm not gonna do that now.

163
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,840
Now those are all aesthetics,
doesn't matter.

164
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,660
So you have connected it.

165
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,860
Exit will exit completely.

166
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,670
That's how you quit.

167
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,980
MSFConsole.

168
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,430
We've got a lot of things down here,
so help for help menus.

169
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,950
And you usually would use,
space -H for commands here.

170
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,790
Just like you would use
in a Linux shell as well.

171
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,240
It would give you a list of options.

172
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,880
Info, it displays info about modules.

173
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,790
We'll soon get into that.

174
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:36,296
You can also save jobs, because in
Metasploit you can issues several jobs and

175
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:38,848
they can all run in the background.

176
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:44,266
And you can list them and then you can
summon them into foreground as well

177
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:50,160
to see what is going on to give you real
time update, so that's not a bad idea.

178
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,850
Now, you might get a, there's
an option that goes like this, Search.

179
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,782
Now if you type in search, and there is
a yellow flag telling you that you're

180
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,800
not connected to a database
after all that we did thus far.

181
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,990
Well, we didn't do that much.

182
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:07,440
We just started two services basically.

183
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,810
We have given Metasploit
a database to use.

184
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:16,360
Just go ahead and type in DB rebuild
cache, the one that I am selecting now.

185
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,456
If that doesn't work,
go ahead and exit Metasploit,

186
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:23,580
reset the computer and repeat the steps.

187
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,340
See if that helps you out.

188
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,284
If it doesn't help you out, come back on
Udemy, post it in the discussions, and

189
00:11:28,284 --> 00:11:29,450
I will see what I can do.

190
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:35,370
But just try resetting it a couple
of times, resetting Metasploit,

191
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,180
resetting post SQL, and
resetting reboot the system.

192
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,190
Don't know why sometimes it breaks.

193
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,180
I don't know.
It's a free version, it's open source, and

194
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,250
it's fantastic.

195
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,310
But of course, it's not perfect.

196
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,400
So you have to work with me here and
adapt a little bit.

197
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,900
Anyway, we will use some
of these commands but

198
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,950
I wanted you to have a look at them,
and just know how to summon them.

199
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,750
I would strongly recommend that you
go at least through some of them,

200
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,870
through at least a couple more
that we're going to use today,

201
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:17,130
just to familiarize yourself with a bit of
extra information, as Metasploit is huge.

202
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,000
It is gigantic.

203
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,530
There are so many things in it.

204
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,500
There are so many exploits.

205
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,810
There are so many modules.

206
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:29,585
There are so many payloads.

207
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:34,239
It is ridiculous.

208
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:36,390
So let me just, banner.

209
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,691
Okay, so there are 1,400 there,
900 here, 244 here,

210
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:47,230
363, 378, I think it sums up around 3k or
something of a kind.

211
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,297
Not sure.

212
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:54,757
But 3,000 things to use in
general is a pretty large number.

213
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:57,457
Plus Metasploit also supports scripting.

214
00:12:57,457 --> 00:13:01,920
You can write your own scripts,
you can use as payloads and deploy them.

215
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,092
It's just ridiculous how
many options it possesses.

216
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:09,148
We're gonna through some of them today,
but

217
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:14,271
I would strongly recommend
that you keep on exploring and

218
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:17,378
see what else you can do with them.

219
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:21,336
Out of 3,000 things basically that
are there something is bound to work.

220
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:27,036
So you have 1,443 exploits that you
can attempt on various systems.

221
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:31,830
Because exploits come with payloads and
axillary comes without payloads.

222
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:37,331
And if you just keep on trying,
something is bound to work.

223
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:39,803
I mean,
they pretty much got an exploit for

224
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:43,250
every single piece of code that
was ever created out there.

225
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,130
Probably not like that but
you get the idea.

226
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,193
You get what I'm saying.

227
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,851
Okay, so
let's just clear it one more time.

228
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:53,912
I like to keep it neat,
and now we're gonna,

229
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:59,810
today we're gonna actually generate an
automatic reverse shelf for Windows 8.1.

230
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,651
How you deploy it is up to you.

231
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:08,739
You have the benefit of the previous
tutorials of me showing you

232
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:14,307
a couple of things with the DNS and
with Wi-Fi, and with all of that,

233
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:19,779
how you can redirect the users,
how you can reroute their traffic,

234
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,867
how you can manipulate it and
you can use some of those methods,

235
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:29,859
actually you can use almost all
of them to actually inject this

236
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:33,960
sort of code onto your victim's computer.

237
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,600
Well, not to inject it, but actually to
trick the user into downloading it and

238
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,120
into running it.

239
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,740
You can even force it by
denying connection, or

240
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,320
by saying that it's a new security feature
of a browser, or something of a kind.

241
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,950
Once the user is redirected to your
website because if you alter the DNS

242
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,680
settings, you can basically say,
whenever the user opens up a browser and

243
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,508
browses for any website, redirect him
here, and you can just say, I don't know,

244
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:08,440
Firefox, or Internet Explorer

245
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,240
requires this piece of
code as a security update.

246
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,340
You need to install, you just need
to click here to install it and

247
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,710
they click there and they install it.

248
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,980
Guess what?

249
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,245
You have a reverse shell back to them.

250
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:23,783
It's not really that difficult.

251
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:25,003
It's not really that hard.

252
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:29,436
Play around with it and
see how it works out for you.

253
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:31,146
Benefits can be numerous.

254
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:36,564
Anyway, before I actually go ahead and
start generating reverse shells,

255
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:42,506
you also have an option search which you
are gonna probably be using extensively.

256
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,425
Let's just usespace-h.

257
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:48,086
And here you have various
arguments it can pass.

258
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:50,185
Here is how it actually looks like.

259
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:53,225
The example of the search command.

260
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:55,405
We will just go ahead type in search.

261
00:15:55,405 --> 00:16:00,545
I like to use name, and
what shall we use with name?

262
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:06,787
Let's say, I want meterpreter,

263
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:10,666
which is a listener.

264
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:15,126
It's a session that you can open.

265
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:19,190
If I got some of the terminology wrong,

266
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,126
feel free to hang me in
the discussion section.

267
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:31,566
I'll be more than happy to
accept any reviews or criticism.

268
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:34,265
Nobody's perfect.

269
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:38,103
But anyway, here you go,
you have these payloads,

270
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:41,865
what else do we got, okay,
so, yep, there we go.

271
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:44,845
These are a bit meter here.

272
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:50,035
Says payload for Android,
I've only set at one

273
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:55,486
meterpreter and
here it's usually reverse TCP,

274
00:16:55,486 --> 00:17:00,287
blind TCP, reverse HTTP, reverse HTTPS,

275
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:04,585
so you can even encrypt the tri-fect.

276
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:06,366
You see there's one for Android for
BSD, out of all operating systems.

277
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:11,866
There's Java one.

278
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:15,956
Java one will work on pretty much
anything that has Java installed on it,

279
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:18,386
which is pretty much anything these days.

280
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:25,665
You even got ones for Linux via PHP.

281
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:27,925
PHP will work on pretty much
anything out there as well.

282
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:32,605
Python, well if they have it
installed sure, if not then not.

283
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:36,740
There we go, so there is payload for
Windows meterpreter,

284
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,805
and then you have different
variants of different types.

285
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:47,152
I have a specific one in mind
that I planned to use today but

286
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,140
feel free to take a look at these.

287
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,360
You have descriptions here.

288
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,820
You have their rating here.

289
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,500
They can be poor, normal and excellent.

290
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,665
I think those three parameters apply, and

291
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:04,490
then you have a description
here of what it actually does.

292
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,990
A brief description of how it is done.

293
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,340
Anyway, let's just go ahead and
clear the screen.

294
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,897
Now that you have some of the basic
options, in the follow up tutorial,

295
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:21,890
I'm gonna come back and actually generate
a reverse shell and see how it works.

296
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,171
There will be a demo.

297
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,930
Until then, I bid you farewell.
